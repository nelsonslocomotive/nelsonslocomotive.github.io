      <font id="role_document0" face="Arial" color="#000000">Chelmsford, Essex, 
      UK built the&nbsp; 7 1/4&quot; gauge 'B' class Shay locomotive show above and 
      was kind enough to share the following photos.&nbsp; The text and captions 
      are Alan's words.&nbsp; The locomotive specifications are at the end of 
      the page.&nbsp; Alan may be contacted at <a href="mailto:BALAN106@aol.com">

      <P align=left><font id="role_document0" face="Arial" color="#000000">The 
      outline is based on the early 1900's style, of a loco&nbsp;of about&nbsp;65 ton 
      size. The model weighs about 300 lbs dry. It uses a conventional copper 
      loco style boiler, coal fired, with 4 radiant type superheaters, and rated 
      at 100psi.&nbsp; It steams well and I've done over 50 miles with it so 
      far. <br>
      <br>
      The 3 cylinder engine uses piston valves, (not quite correct for period), 
      but I wanted an engine that would rev freely, which it does, light engine 
      it will do over 10 mph. Cylinders are 1 3/8&quot; bore by 1 1/2&quot; stroke, using 
      alloy pistons with cast iron rings.<br>
      <br>
      I've fitted a steam brake system for the rear truck and vacuum brakes for 
      the front one to be compatible with braking systems on most UK club 
      passenger stock. The driving truck I use also acts as a coupling converter 
      between the buckeye couplers (from your Railroad Warehouse Co.) and UK 
      style buffers and drawhook &amp; chain.<br>
      <br>
      The loco is essentially all my own design, based on information wherever I 
      could find it, including your site which I found quite useful.&nbsp;Castings, 
      apart from&nbsp;the wheels, were produced by a local foundry from patterns that 
      I made.&nbsp;<br>

      The brass cylinders in front of the cylinder blocks are steam operated

      carry over. (A bad driver who lets the boiler water level get too high!)

      <font face="Arial">7 ¼” GAUGE SHAY LOCOMOTIVE&nbsp; SPECIFICATIONS</font></b></P>
      <P align=left>
      <font face="Arial"><b>1. GENERAL.</b><br>
      Mainline gauge model, i.e. 1/8 scale.<br>
      Based on Lima “B” Class Shay, of about 65 tons, of early 1900’s<br>
      Overall size, 65” long, 14.5” wide and 20” high.<br>
      Dry weight is about 280 lbs, ( ~ 300 lbs working).<br>
      Project was started in May 2005, engine first run, without cab etc, in 
      July 2007.<br>
      Model is not quite complete, needs domes, bell, pinion guards etc etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. DESIGN.</b><br>
      Aim was to produce a loco which would travel easily at 5 to 6 mph and thus 
      be suitable for passenger hauling on Club tracks. (That is real, not scale 
      speed).<br>
      The overall size and weight had to be compatible with my estate car.<br>
      It is thus my own design, based on information from books and the Web, 
      mostly USA based sites.<br>
      Was designed to be easy to operate and maintain, as far as possible.<br>
      Designed on a PC with a 2D CAD system, “Turbocad” v4.<br>
      Some attention was paid to lubrication methods, and replaceable bearing 
      bushes.<br>
      Design of individual parts was made compatible with my machining 
      facilities.<br>
      Note that the design is in metric dimensions, I have quoted inches here 
      when convenient.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. SUB ASSEMBLIES.</b><br>
      Boiler <br>
      Copper boiler, coal fired, of conventional locomotive type, 100 psi rated.<br>
      Barrel 6” diameter, 17” long, firegrate 6” x 4.5”.<br>
      16 fluetubes and 4 super heater flues with stainless steel radiant type 
      elements.<br>
      - I had the boiler made professionally.<br>
      Water feed is by rear truck mounted axle pump, injector or Wier pump.<br>
&nbsp;</font></P>
      <P align=left>
      <font face="Arial">Engine<br>
      3 cylinder, piston valve, Stephenson’s valve gear.<br>
      Scaled from full size 11” bore by 12” stroke engine, ie 36mm x 38mm.<br>
      Pistons are aluminium alloy with two cast iron rings.<br>
      Piston valve bore is 18mm, using 3 part stainless steel bobbins with cast 
      iron rings.<br>
      The 3 throw crankshaft is of built up construction, Loctite(603) and 
      pinned, with case hardened big end journals. The 3/4” diameter shaft runs 
      in bronze bearings, the centre ones being split. <br>
      The central eccentric pair is also split.<br>
      All the engine casings are to my design, cast by a local commercial 
      foundry in spheroidal graphite iron, (a ductile grade and beautiful to 
      machine!). <br>
      Note: I am aware that all the early engines were slide valve, but I wanted 
      a loco that would not be an unwelcome slowcoach on the track, so I 
      designed an engine that would rev freely. It needs ~800rpm do travel at 
      6mph (model velocity), which it does comfortably.<br>
      I understand some early locos were re-engined if they got damaged.<br>
      &nbsp;</font></P>
      <P align=left>
      <font face="Arial">Trucks<br>
      Based on the early bar frame design.<br>
      Bar frame section 14 x 5mm black bar, 12 x 3mm for top braces, bottom 
      angles 12 x 12 x 3mm.<br>
      Wheel diameter 116mm, (~ 4.5”). These are commercial front bogie wheel 
      castings for a 7 ¼” Gauge “King” class GWR 4-6-2 locomotive!<br>
      Gear ratio is 1.75:1, a bit lower than most Shays, (it also made the 
      pinion manufacture a bit easier). Gears are 35T and 20T, which I cut 
      myself.<br>
      I made the patterns for the truck castings, cast as for engine parts.<br>
      The axles run in two-row self aligning ball bearings on the gear side, and 
      a standard sealed ball race on the other end in the sprung axle box, both 
      12mm bore.<br>
      The pinion shaft runs in porous bronze bearing bushes.<br>
      The truck pivots on a ball thrust race (slightly preloaded) with limit 
      stops to prevent damage to the universal joints etc in the case of a 
      derailment.<br>
      Universal joints and sliding shafts much as Mr Shay designed them, shafts 
      are ½” square, sockets are two pieces of bright steel angle silver 
      soldered together.<br>
      Cast iron brakes shoes on both trucks, chassis mounted vacuum actuator for 
      front truck, (to be compatible with most UK passenger stock), steam power 
      cylinder for the rear truck coupled with screw down cab handbrake.<br>
&nbsp;</font></P>
      <P align=left>
      <font face="Arial">Chassis<br>
      Main rails 20 x 40 mm hot rolled channel (single piece) with substantial 
      plate and channel drag boxes for the “Railroad Warehouse” couplers, (very 
      nice), and one channel frame stretcher. <br>
      The truck pivot bearing housing plate bolts to the side channels to allow 
      easy removal of a truck without any other loco dismantling.<br>
      Oak buffer beams of 26 x 40mm section complete the chassis.<br>
&nbsp;</font></P>
      <P align=left>
      <font face="Arial">Cab <br>
      Outline based on the early loco type, with typical Shay features.<br>
      Designed to lift off after removal of securing nuts to cab floorplate for 
      easy maintenance access to cab pipework and controls.<br>
      Removable cab roof section for ease of driving.<br>
      All timber construction in fine grained pine,(ex 1970’s window frame!)<br>
      Timber has been varnished, I have no idea what the full size did, but it 
      looks nice!<br>
      Front windows hinge open, side windows slide, both with hardwood frames 
      and Perspex panes.<br>
      The internal arrangement of controls has been made to make driving as 
      comfortable as possible.<br>
&nbsp;</font></P>
      <P align=left>
      <font face="Arial">Water tank<br>
      Outline based on the early loco type, with typical Shay rivet patterns.<br>
      Standard construction of sheet and small section angle, riveted together.<br>
      Sides fixed to floorplate to make a removable sub assembly.<br>
      Capacity nearly two gallons (UK).<br>
