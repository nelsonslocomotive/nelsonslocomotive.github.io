    <p align="left">I spent a month in the summer of 2003 working in Pristina, the capital
    of Kosova.&nbsp; Before going there I had done a bit of research and found
    there was a rail system with passenger service to most of the cities in the
    region.&nbsp; Upon arrival I learned that the rail system was being run by
    UNMIK (UN Mission In Kosova) and there is no rail service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">One Saturday a colleague and I drove about 100 KM northwest to Peje, near the borders
    with Albania and Montenegro to hike in the mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
    stopped for a few minutes at the edge of the city near a rail yard where I
    took the following photos.</p>
      <p align="left">The first thing I noticed was the different shape of the
      freight cars.....&nbsp; </p>
      <P align=center><img border="0" src="FreightCars.jpg" width="700" height="310"></P>
      <P align=center>The European style couplers .......</P>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Coupler.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
    <p align="center">And the single axel trucks on some of the cars ..</p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Truck.jpg" width="400" height="273"></p>
      <P align=center>There was a small turntable,&nbsp; probably used to turn around the
      diesel electric locomotives.&nbsp;</P>
      <P align=center><img border="0" src="Roundtable1.jpg" width="699" height="260"></P>
      <P align=center>This is the view from the other side of the turntable showing the
      mountains.&nbsp; The turntable is in the valley at about 500 meters
      elevation, the highest peaks in the area are at ~2500 meters.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Had a beautiful day in the mountains guided by one of the locals who had
      fought in these mountains during the
      war.&nbsp;</P>
      <P align=center><img border="0" src="Roundtable2.jpg" width="700" height="412"></P>
      <P align=center>The turntable is hand operated.</P>
      <P align=center><img border="0" src="Roundtable3.jpg" width="426" height="410"></P>
    <P align=center>The track seems in pretty good shape.&nbsp; However, apparently
    no trains have moved on this track in several years&nbsp;</P>
      <P align=center><img border="0" src="Trackwork.jpg" width="727" height="392"></P>
      <P align=center>There was an old engine house, but no locomotives in the
      area.&nbsp;</P>
      <P align=center><img border="0" src="EngineHouse.jpg" width="532" height="399"></P>
    <P align=center>I later visited the yards at Pristina where apparently all
    the locomotives in the country are setting.&nbsp; This one seems very old
    but appears to be operational.&nbsp; Maybe it was out of the country during the war.&nbsp;
    The blue and white sign identifies it as UNMIK.&nbsp; These photos were
    taken midmorning on a Friday.&nbsp; There were a couple people hammering
    around or on a locomotive in an engine house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the
    tracks in this area showed recent use.&nbsp;</P>
      <P align=center><img border="0" src="Locomotive1.jpg" width="700" height="289"></P>
      <P align=center>This locomotive is much newer and marked KFOR --- Kosova
      FORce --- the NATO military.&nbsp; The KFOR markings were obviously put on the
      locomotive after the war -- 1999 or later.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to have
      been damaged.</P>
      <P align=center><img border="0" src="Locomotive2.jpg" width="700" height="340"></P>
      <P align=center>These are some older smaller locomotives.&nbsp; If I read
      the Serbian markings correctly, they were manufactured in Belgrade.</P>
      <P align=center><img border="0" src="Locomotive3.jpg" width="700" height="382"></P>
      <P align=center><img border="0" src="Locomotive4.jpg" width="700" height="418"></P>
      <P align=center>This is an interesting axel.&nbsp; Wonder how many
      decades it has been setting there.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no sign of the
      remainder of this or any other steam locomotive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
