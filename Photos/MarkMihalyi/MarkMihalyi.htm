      <P align=left><font face="Arial">Mark Mihalyi&nbsp; lives southwest of Pittsburgh.&nbsp;
      He spotted the NLW website and we exchanged some data on Shay progress.&nbsp;
      When I mentioned that a friend and I were going to Cass he suggested
      that we stop by his shop for a chat and see his shays.</font></P>

          <td valign="top">While Mark was showing us around my friend (a guy
            with several Triumphs) noticed a car with a car cover.&nbsp; He said
            that it looked like a TR6 front spoiler sticking below the
            cover.&nbsp; We were some distance away with a view under the
            car.&nbsp; I said it wasn't a Triumph since there were no puddles
            underneath.&nbsp; Turns out that it was a beautiful '76 TR6 that
            Mark purchased new.&nbsp;&nbsp; We spend a bit of time discussing
            the normal TR problems.&nbsp; I didn't ask but suspect that Mark
            drained all the fluids before storing it in the fall.&nbsp; That
            would explain the lack of puddles. </td>

      <P align=left><font face="Arial">&nbsp;Mark is building two Shays at
      once.&nbsp; He didn't explain why he was building two, however, I suspect
      it relates to his Triumph experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the folks with
      Triumphs have two or more.&nbsp; There reason is, especially here in the
      north,&nbsp; top down weather is a short part of the year so one doesn't
      want to miss the whole year due to a failure, which is likely.&nbsp; I've found that it's best to have three, one to drive, one
      to have torn down for restoration and the third to be on jacks awaiting
      repair parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; This readily extends to locomotives.&nbsp; I
      think a Shay, a Climax and a Heisler would make a really nice stable. </font></P>
      <P align=left><font face="Arial">Mark has the trucks and frames done as
      seen below.&nbsp; He's beginning to work on the engines.&nbsp; He has a
      shop with a large lathe and mill so it's ideal for live steaming.&nbsp; (I bet he tells
      the wife he has to work a lot of
      overtime.) </P>

              earlier photo of Mark's frames -- it looks like he had found scale
              I beams.&nbsp; Mark explained that he made the I beams from two
              channels as per Kenneth's drawings.&nbsp; He first tried welding
              the two channels together but that distorted the pieces. &nbsp; He
              then tried brazing the two channels together and that worked
              well.&nbsp;&nbsp; He milled the tops and bottoms smooth as
              shown in the photo on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wish I'd done that.</td>
