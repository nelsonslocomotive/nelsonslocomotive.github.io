    <p align="left">At the suggestion of a friend I did a bit of research on the 
    Garratt locomotive before going to Tanzania in the summer of 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The Garratts seemed really neat.&nbsp; I also learned that there are a bunch 
    of Garratts at the Railway Museum in Nairobi (Kenya) and that there is regular shuttle bus service from where I was going to 
    be in Arusha, Tanzania to Nairobi.&nbsp;&nbsp; After several weeks in Arusha 
    I had the opportunity to take a three day weekend so I took the ~5 hour 
    shuttle to Nairobi on Saturday, visited the museum on Sunday and returned to 
    Arusha on Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the museum all to myself on Sunday --- 
    laterally ---- there was no other visitor.&nbsp; I was able to climb all 
    over the Garratts without anyone telling me to get off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">The museum has a number of interesting displays which tell 
    the history of the railway that ran from Mombasa on the coast through 
    Nairobi to Lake Victoria.&nbsp; The following brief history of the Kenya 
    Railways was on a large poster in the museum:&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center"><i><b>A Brief History of the Kenya Railways</b></i></p>
    <p align="left"><i>The idea of a railway in this part of Africa came about 
    in the late 1880s when both Germany and Britain were actively interested in 
    acquiring territory in the region.&nbsp;&nbsp; In July 1890, Germany and 
    Britain signed the treaty of Berlin and divided the region then ruled by the 
    Sultan of Zanzibar&nbsp;and now know as Kenya and Tanzania, into British 
    and German East Africa.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards both colonies began 
    surveying routes from the coast to Lake Victoria, the source of the River 
    Nile.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Germans started a line from Tanga towards Mount 
    Kilimanjaro, while the British surveyed a route from Mombasa.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
    December 1895, George Whitehouse stepped ashore at Mombasa and in May 1896, 
    the first rails were laid of the project that would become known as the 
    'Lunatic line&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its name was coined in a speech in Parliament in 
    London regarding the every increasing cost of what appeared to be a futile 
    exercise.</i></p>
    <p align="left"><i>Metre gauge track and rolling stock came from India 
    together with large numbers of craftsmen.&nbsp; Construction was plagued 
    with numerous difficulties including man eating loins, hostile tribes , wild 
    animals that attacked the trains, mosquitoes, flies, locusts and 
    caterpillars 
    that caused the locomotives to slip on the rails.&nbsp;&nbsp; Torrential 
    rains washed away bridges and track and derailed trains.&nbsp; When the line 
    reached a level area at a place known as Nyrobi, a workshop was built and 
    preparations made for the difficult upcountry construction.&nbsp; This area 
    eventually grew into what is now the capitol city of Nairobi.&nbsp; When the 
    railroad reached the edge of the Great Rift Valley, Whitehouse built an 
    inclined line in four stages down the side, at an angle of 45 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    This enabled construction to proceed along the valley floor 
    while a gentile slope was cut down the side.&nbsp; On reaching the other 
    side, numerous wooden bridges, later replaced by steel, had to be built to 
    carry the track across deep ravines.&nbsp;&nbsp; The line reached Lake 
    Victoria in December 1901.&nbsp; On reaching the lake at Kisumu passengers 
    would take a steamer to Port Beil in Uganda before proceeding by road to 
    Kampala the capital.</i></p>
    <p align="left"><i>It was named the Uganda Railway which remained in use 
    until 1926 when it was renamed the Kenya Uganda Railway.&nbsp; In 1948 the 
    Tanganyika Railway and the K. U. R. amalgamated to form the East African 
    Railways and Harbours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the three countries of Kenya, 
    Uganda and Tanzania separated in 1977, the lines from Mombasa to the 
    Tanzania and Uganda borders became Kenya Railways.</i></p>
    <p align="left">Note that German East Africa was lost to the British during 
    World War I.&nbsp;&nbsp; The movie Africa Queen takes place during that war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img border="0" src="Map.jpg" width="720" height="478"></i></p>
    <p align="left">The map above (photographed at the museum) shows&nbsp; the 
    route of the Uganda Railroad. &nbsp; Mombasa is on the coast on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Kisusmu , the other end of the railroad in on lake Victoria on the left 
    side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The red line is the route of the shuttle bus I took between between 
    Arusha and Nairobi.&nbsp; Ngorongoro Crater and Serengeti are places I visited on 
    safari a few weeks after the trip to the Nairobi.&nbsp; Note that the 
    equator is about 100 miles north of Nairobi but the temperature is usually 
    in the 70s in the afternoon because of the high altitude. </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">The chart above shows the grades on the railroad.&nbsp; 
      The horizontal distance is 1000 miles and each horizontal line represents 
      1000 feet of elevation.&nbsp; Mombasa is on the left at sea level and Lake 
      Victoria is on the right at a little over 3000 feet elevation.&nbsp; The red 
      dot is Nairobi at ~5500 ft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dip to the right of Nairobi is the 
      Great Rift Valley. </p>
