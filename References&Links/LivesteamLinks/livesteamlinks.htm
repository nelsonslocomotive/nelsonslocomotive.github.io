      Works</a>&nbsp; </b>Jim Buchanan has built a really neat Class B
      Climax.&nbsp; He casts many of the parts in Aluminum.&nbsp; It sounds
      complicated, but for a graduate of The Ohio State University's College of
      Engineering,&nbsp; nothing is beyond his capability ---- Buckeye's can
      do more than dominate the athletic fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

        Burrell Engine (Tractor)&nbsp; The site shows how he made some of the casting 
        patterns.&nbsp; Conrad uses 3 phase machinery in his shop powered via a 
        converter.&nbsp; Us amateurs in the US might consider the same since used 3 
        phase machinery is usually priced much less that single phase 
        equipment.&nbsp; The price of new single phase to three phase converters has 
        really dropped making such an arrangement very economic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
