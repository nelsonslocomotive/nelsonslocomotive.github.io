    <p align=left>Fabricating the engine steam and exhaust pipes seem to be the last items
    that require moving the boiler around; hopefully when these are completed the
    boiler can be secured and I can move on to less weighty subjects.</p>

            photo of Cass No 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The steam pipe comes out of the
            boiler just below the steam dome&nbsp; and the exhaust pipe goes
            into the side of the smoke box.&nbsp; Kenneth's design has the steam
            pipe coming out the side of the steam dome and the exhaust going
            into the bottom of the smoke box.&nbsp;</td>

          <td><b>Flanges: </b>Kenneth specified flanges on each end of the
            1/2&quot; steam pipe that runs from the steam dome to the steam
            header.&nbsp; His drawings seemed to indicate that the 3/4&quot;
            exhaust pipe is to be&nbsp; soldered to the exhaust manifold at the engine end
            and to the flange in the bottom of the smoke box at the front
            end.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prototype had the exhaust pipe as a separate
            piece with flanges that bolt to exhaust manifold at the rear and
            the pipe from the smoke box at the front (previous photo).&nbsp; This seems to
            be a more prudent arrangement --- easier to disassemble.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            So, I made the four flanges shown on the right for the exhaust
            system.&nbsp; The ID matches the OD of the 3/4&quot; copper exhaust
            pipe.&nbsp; A similar pair of flanges were made for the 1/2&quot;
            steam pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

          <td>The flanges were made from 1/8&quot; CFS.&nbsp; They were sawed
            from bar stock and then squared up on the mill.&nbsp;&nbsp; The four
            were stacked and 1/16&quot; holes drilled in the corners and roll
            pins driven into the holes to keep the pieces aligned and
            together.&nbsp; A 1/4&quot; hole was then drilled in the center and
            the pieces mounted in the lathe 4-jaw chuck and centered using the setup on the right ----&nbsp; a length of 3/8&quot;
            rod was center drilled on one end and a short length turned to
            1/4&quot; on the other end.&nbsp; The rod was then inserted between
            the tailstock and flanges and the chuck adjusted so that the rod was
            centered.&nbsp; The flanges were then drilled and bored to the
            correct ID.&nbsp; Later, the four attachment holes were drilled to
            the correct size for 4-40 screws.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

          <td><b>Exhaust Pipe: </b>The exhaust line between the engine exhaust manifold and the
    exhaust inlet in the bottom of the smoke box was done first.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            flanges were silver soldered to the elbows as was the elbow to the big
            flange at the bottom of the smoke box.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was afraid that
            these joints would come apart if the 45
            degree elbow was silver soldered into the 90 degree elbow connected
            to the big
            flange.&nbsp; Instead, that joint was soldered&nbsp; with 550 degree solder
            (98.5% tin, 1.5% silver).&nbsp; This solder doesn't flow easily so the joint
            was tinned with a a thin coat of solder in flux paste.&nbsp;
            The solder then flowed easily and the temperature of the
            combination&nbsp; seemed about the same as the 550 degree solder
            alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    <p align=left>The photo above shows the rest of the exhaust run. All the
    joints were silver soldered except the one indicated.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pipe
    was kept away from the boiler by 5/16&quot;.&nbsp; The lagging will be
    1/4&quot; so the pipe will be right next to the boiler jacket.</p>

            pipe.&nbsp; This photo shows the steam pipe just after the joints
            were silver soldered (all joints were silver soldered).&nbsp; The
            block at the end of the steam inlet header was made from 1.5&quot;
            diameter brass.&nbsp; There is a 1/8&quot; MTP threaded hole in the
            end for the pipe from the lubricator.&nbsp;
