              can be a slot for the pipe in the cab front rather than a hole.&nbsp;

              pipes don't need to be removed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The black marks on the

    <p align=left>The photo above shows the back part of the pipe and the
      hose.&nbsp; With all the bends it sort of looks like a miniature exhaust
      pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; This job whole job turned out to be much less difficult
    that anticipated.&nbsp; The bent
      pipe took very little effort.&nbsp; Starting at one rear end the pipe
    was heated and
      quenched in the area for the first bend,&nbsp; the bend made around a !'
    piece of steel rod, the area for the next bend was then heated it, etc.&nbsp;</p>

            pipe but the brake rod was in the way so this was about the only
            alternative.&nbsp;

    <p><b>Hydrostatic Test:&nbsp;</b> With the feed water plumbing in place it was
    possible to do a hydrostatic test of the boiler and associated
    plumbing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally one would fill the boiler via the blowdown
    valve.&nbsp; However, an&nbsp; adaptor to connect to the drain valve hadn't
    been made so both the hand and axel pumps were
    used.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compressed air was connected to drive the engine.&nbsp;
    The water level was checked from time-to-time however, apparently not often
    enough as water made it to the engine.&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine sort of choked up and
    stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The hand pump was then used to build the pressure.&nbsp; Once all the air
    was expunged, the pressure builds from zero to 100 pounds with only a few
    pump strokes.&nbsp; Again, wasn't too attentive and safety valves&nbsp;
    operated and squirted water about 10 feet across workshop.&nbsp; What a
    shock!&nbsp; (Later showed the system to the daughter --- also an
    engineer.&nbsp; Explained everything and then pumped it up.&nbsp;&nbsp; She
    really jumped when the safety valves let go and squirted the water.&nbsp;
    Should have positioned her so that she would have been sprayed.)</p>
    <p>Next, the pressure was pumped up to just less than 100 psi and the system
    checked for leaks.&nbsp; There were several leaks, mostly valves and a
    couple compression nuts. After everything was tightened&nbsp; there was one
    very small leak in a fitting next to the axel pump control
    valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will probably just soft solder it since most of the
    assembly would have to be taken apart to get at it.&nbsp; (This joint is not
    subjected to steam but will use the 550 degree solder anyway.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The safety valves wept a little but don't think&nbsp; it's a
    concern.&nbsp; The test cock at the bottom of the water gauge continued to
    leak but not as much as with air.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cock will probably have
    to be replaced with a regular 3/16&quot; globe valve. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>The steam chamber cover leaked under air pressure but didn't leak
    with water.&nbsp; This was as predicted by Murray Curtis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The safety valves were held off and the pressure pumped up to 200
    psi.&nbsp; Other&nbsp; than the leaks mentioned earlier, no
    problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The valves on all the boiler ports were then
    closed and it was verified that the boiler verified would hold pressure.</p>
    <p><b>Water Gauge Test:</b>&nbsp; Recall that I was advised that the top of
    the water gauge shouldn't be connected to the turret because the water lever
    would vary when steam was drawn from the turret.&nbsp; To test this, the
    water level was set half way up the gauge and the system charged to about
    100 psi with compressed air and the valve in the air input pipe closed
    off.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1/4&quot; blower valve was fully opened to the
    atmosphere (the pipe to the blower had not yet been connected to the
    valve).&nbsp; This is probably a worse case test.&nbsp; The water lever in
    the gauge increase some --- maybe a half inch.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is probably
    tolerable but it's clearly a bad practice.&nbsp; So ...... I'll go back and
    move the input to a dedicated port on the top of the
    boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After all the testing some of the water was drained from the tank and
    compressed air was fed to the boiler so that the engine could be run to
    clear out any remaining water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the water got cleaned out
    ---- it ended up all over the ceiling above the smokestack.&nbsp; Another
    lesson learned ---- the hard way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>On to making the fire........&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
