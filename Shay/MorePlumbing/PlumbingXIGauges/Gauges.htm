        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">At the end of the first run
        I had trouble starting the burner and ended up with flames coming out
        the firebox door and up the backhead.&nbsp; The flames melted the
        pressure gauge lens and also damaged the gauge movement.&nbsp; The
        siphon tube hangs down below the gauge and is right above the firebox
        door so the flames probably boiled the water out of the siphon tube
        allowing steam to reach the gauge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">I later read Kozo
        Hiraoka's description of how to build a pressure gauge in <u>Building
        the Heisler</u>&nbsp;and decided that if he could build a gauge I should
        be able to repair one. &nbsp; I disassembled the gauge and found that
        the solder joints at each end of the bourdon tube were leaking.&nbsp;
        These joints were repaired and the gauge now works.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dick
        McCloy donated a glass lens so the gauge is like new except where I
        scorched the dial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Before I repaired the gauge
        I ordered a replacement from McMaster-Carr.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no mention
        that the replacement would work with steam however, it had a
        temperature range up to 150 degrees F.&nbsp; Listed on the same catalog page
        were large boiler pressure gauges that had a pressure range up to140 degrees F
        so the siphon tube must do a great job of limiting the temperature (if
        you don't build a fire under it).&nbsp; Later I found some similar every
        inexpensive gauges at the MSC&nbsp;Industrial Supply website and decided to purchase a couple of
        them.&nbsp; After I disassembled all the gauges I realized that they were
        very similar and all would probably work on the shay.&nbsp; When I had
        everything apart I decided to take a few photos and pass on the
        information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      this note is not a recommendation that the gauges be used in a steam

      <p>One can't help but wonder at the price disparity between the two US
      Gauges.&nbsp;&nbsp; One possible explanation is that Ametek moved production of
      this gauge offshore recently to achieve a significant cost
      reduction.&nbsp;&nbsp; The supplier to the hobby may be using higher cost made in the USA
      gauges from stock.&nbsp; Also, MSC is a much larger volume purchaser compared
      to the supplier to the hobby.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>So, which gauge do I prefer?&nbsp; The Dial on the US Gauge is easiest
      to read and if everything else is equal, that is what I'll use.&nbsp; A
      glass lens would be nice since it is easy to clean.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I
      suspect the polycarbonate&nbsp; (plastic) lens is used where possible to
      minimize broken glass risk.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Utility gauge from MSC has a
      glass lens but the gauge is less accurate than the other gauges (5% vs 2%)&nbsp;
      and the dual scale dial is harder to read. One could probably get some
      glass lenses from a local glass shop, but it might be cheaper to buy the
      Utility Gauge for $5 from MSC, take out the glass lens and throw the rest
      away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>My second choice is the $9.92 Ashcroft gauge from McMaster-Carr.&nbsp;
      The dial is slightly harder to read than the US gauge.&nbsp; The
      construction of the lens is different than the other four gauges in that
      the retaining ring is part of the lens and one can't remove the lens and
      replace it with glass or plastic from another gauge.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If I won the lottery I'd probably use the Ashcroft stainless steel Gauge form
      McMaster-Carr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To find out more about the gauges from <a href="http://mcmaster.com">McMaster-
      Carr</a> or <a href="http://mscdirect.com">MSC</a>, one can go to their
      website (click on the name), enter the gauge part number listed above
      which will bring up a description of the individual gauge.&nbsp; There is
      a link from that page to the catalog page which gives a more detailed
      description of the family of gauges and lists available pressure ranges
      for the family of gauges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The gauges currently installed on my shay are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Boiler pressure: The $9.92&nbsp; Ashcroft Gauge (0-200 psi) from
          McMaster-Carr.</li>
        <li>Blower pressure:&nbsp; The $4.33 US Gauge (0-60 psi) from MSC.</li>
        <li>Atomizer pressure: The $34 US Gauge (0-30 psi) from supplier to the
          hobby. &nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'll update this if any fail or if I switch gauges for any reason.</p>
