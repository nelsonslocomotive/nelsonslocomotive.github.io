    advice from readers and experience from initial tests.&nbsp; The more
    significant changes are noted in the text.</b></i></p>
    <p align=left>The layout of the steam, water and burner controls on and
    around the boiler backhead proved to be quite a challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of different
    live steam locomotives were examined and probably 50 different
    variations were sketched&nbsp; (a good way to kill time on long
    flights).&nbsp; Near the end of this process an organization of the controls and gauges into functional
    groups evolved.&nbsp; The following lists this organization.&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p align="left">The steam turret is located on the top rear of the boiler.&nbsp; The turret contains cutoff valves that supply steam to
        the&nbsp; whistle valve, to the steam brake valve, and to a
        manifold for the blower and atomizer valves.&nbsp; There is
        also a port for the steam pressure gauge and spare ports for possible
        later use to supply steam to a steam water pump and/or
        injector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">The water controls are on the left side of the
        boiler.&nbsp; These controls are a
        valve to adjust
        the axel pump output and a test valve to verify that the axle pump is
        working.&nbsp; The water
        gauge is on the left side of the backhead and the steam pressure gauge
        is in front of the backhead next to the water gauge.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">The blower &amp; atomizer valves are mounted on a
        manifold near the
        floor to the right of the boiler.&nbsp; The blower pipe runs through the right stay tube to the
        smoke box.&nbsp; The atomizer valve serves an on/off function to supply
        the atomizer regulator located under the platform that covers the
        reversing gear lever.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;manifold is fed
        steam through a cutoff valve from the steam turret.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        manifold is also fed compressed air via a quick connect fitting under the right side of the cab floor.&nbsp;
        There is a cutoff valve and check valve in series with this air
        supply.&nbsp; There are pressure gauges for both the blower and atomizer
        located above the platform that covers the reversing gear lever.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">The steam brake valve and whistle valve are located on
        the shelf above the rear cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">The oil feed valve is located in the oil tank with the
        knob at the top of the tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>

              turret made.&nbsp; One problem was getting the fittings to seal in
              the rounded sides.&nbsp; This was solved by making little bosses
              on the sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another problem was that some of the
              holes were tapped too large;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>the MTP taps should
              only be screwed in about 40% of the tap length</b>.&nbsp; If the
              hole proves too small, the tap can&nbsp; be used again to make it
              slightly larger.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Unfortunately, nothing can be done
              to make a hole smaller.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>The turret body (upper rod) is 3/4&quot;
              diameter.&nbsp; The holes are 1/2&quot; for the nipple and
              3/8&quot; diameter the side ports.&nbsp; The holes in the body were drilled undersize and then
              reamed.&nbsp; The ports were tapped 5/16&quot; MTP at one end 1/4&quot; MTP at the
              other.&nbsp;&nbsp; The end of the nipple was turned down to
              1/2&quot;.&nbsp; It would have been better if the rod was
              drilled lengthwise before drilling the holes through the side.</p>

            <td colspan="2"><b>Water Gauge:</b>&nbsp; Jim Buchanan had advised
              that the water gauge not be connected to the turret because&nbsp; the water level would fluctuate when the steam supplied to other turret ports
              varied.&nbsp; I decided to try it on the turret anyway.&nbsp; (<i>This reminds
              me of a story told by a female engineer colleague.&nbsp; She said
              that male engineers are like little boys, about 5% will listen to
              good advice while the other 95% will pee on an electric
              fence</i>.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>Murry Curtis of Melbourne sent along a couple comments after
              this page was first posted.&nbsp; He says that the small boiler
              code down under specifies a separate boiler port for the water gauge
              because even small pressure differentials can cause a large change
              in water level (remember that atmospheric pressure at ~ 15 psi
              will raise a water column ~ 30 feet).&nbsp;&nbsp; He also said
              that the pipe from boiler to water gauge must be straight so that
              a rod can be pushed through it to show it's not plugged by
              scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I also found that when testing with compressed air, opening the
              blower valve caused the water level to increase maybe 25% of the
              glass height giving a very false reading.&nbsp; So, I moved the
              top to a dedicated boiler port..</p>

              <p>The photo shows the redone water gauge.&nbsp; The bottom of the water gauge screws
              directly into a 1/8&quot; NPT in the backhead.&nbsp; The top port
              of the gauge is threaded 1/4&quot;-40 but apparently not tapered; otherwise it
              matches MTP 1/4&quot;-40.&nbsp; The cutoff valve (LSM 1/4&quot;)
              connects to the boiler via&nbsp; a 1/4&quot;
              nipple.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pipe between the valve and top of the
              gauge is also 1/4&quot; tube threaded MTP each end.&nbsp; The
              connection at the top of the gauge didn't leak even though only
              the male part was tapered.&nbsp; Maybe the Permatex No2 used on
              all the joints helped.&nbsp;&nbsp; The union that is part of the
              valve together with the valves at each end of the gauge permits
              the glass to be replaced without reducing boiler pressure.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The test cock at the bottom permits both pipes from the boiler to be

            <td><b>Safety Valves: </b>The last thing before pressure testing was
              to install the pair of safety valves in the top of the steam
              dome.&nbsp;&nbsp; The holes were tapped 1/8&quot; NPT.&nbsp; These
              valves are brass body with stainless steel ball intended for air
              service.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not clear if the spring is stainless
              steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; It'd probably be wise to buy a package of
              suitable stainless steel springs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>Murry also had some comment about the exhaust
              capability of the safety valves.&nbsp; He describes a test of the
              safety valves as follows (both safety valves working) : <i>For the
              coal fired locos we’re required to build up a good fire, water
              at the top nut and put the blower full on. The pressure (on a
              calibrated gauge) must not exceed the working pressure by more
              than 10% for the time it takes the water to reach the bottom nut,
              5-10 minutes.&nbsp; It’s interesting that a lot of the designs
              published in England will fail on this requirement I've been told.
              Usually because the steam can get past the valve seat fast enough
              but then can't get out of the safety valve body. Some designs call
              for a couple of nicks in the side of the adjusting nut, that’s
              all! No wonder the steam can't get out.&nbsp;</i></p>
              <p><b>Update 4/24/04: </b>The safety valves worked OK in a number
              of steam tests.&nbsp; One problem is that about 15 psi pressure
              drop is required before the valves shut off.&nbsp; At some point
              I'll make least least one valve that requires only a couple psi
              drop to shut off.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made the deflectors shown in the
              lower photo to deflect the relief steam upward.&nbsp; The bottom
              of the deflector has a hole for&nbsp; the 1/8&quot; pipe safety
              valve and the inside is just large enough to clear a 1/2&quot;
              deep socket.&nbsp;&nbsp; The outside is slightly less than
              7/8&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The valves could have been located a little
              further apart such as on 1.25&quot; centers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>End

            <td rowspan="2"><b>Testing With Air:</b> The next step was to connect the air
              line as shown in the photo.&nbsp; The regulator has quick connects
              on both sides.&nbsp; The pressure was set for about 50 pounds and
              then the most obvious leaks fixed&nbsp; ------ a few open valves
              and drain holes not plugged.&nbsp; The pressure was then increased
              to 100 psi and the safety valves adjusted to go off at 100
              psi.&nbsp; The throttle was opened and the engine
              tested.&nbsp;&nbsp; The air supply to run the engine is limited
              since it must go through the 1/4&quot; OD tube between the air
              input and the steam manifold.&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine did run but
              fairly slowly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p><b>Testing For Leaks:&nbsp; </b>The next step was to brush a
              soap solution (liquid dishwashing detergent in water) on the
              joints.&nbsp; The photo shows a few problems.&nbsp; (There seems
              to be bubbles everywhere ---- did every joint leak?&nbsp; That's
              an unknown since all haven't been tested yet.)&nbsp; The joints
              were tightened a bit and the leaks stopped.&nbsp; There are also
              leaks around the steam dome top and two of the upper heads.&nbsp;
              Those joints have gaskets but will try a bit of Permatex No 2 to
              see if that helps.&nbsp; One pretty significant leak is the test
              cock at the bottom of the water gauge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That cock
              uses a tapered plug.&nbsp; Think I'll test it in boiling water
              ---- friend Dan Staron says those cocks seal better when
              hot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is some hope that steam is
              thicker than air and won't leak as easily.</p>
              <p>Another comment from Murry Curtis: <i>Testing any steam
              appliance with air is sure to give you heart ache. Air&nbsp;
              squirts past things that hot steam/water won't even dribble out
              of.&nbsp; I first tested my copper boiler under water with air pressure
              and nearly died when the water bubbled like a spa. The boiler
              inspector just laughed at me and pumped up the boiler with water -
              not a drop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>

    <p align="left">From Murray's comments it appears that steam is thicker than
    air.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now need some steam which requires water and fire so it's on to the water
    plumbing and burner.&nbsp;</p>
