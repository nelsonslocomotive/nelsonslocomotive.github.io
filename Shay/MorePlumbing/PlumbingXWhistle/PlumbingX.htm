      <p>There's snow on the ground and it's too cold to do any more steaming
      tests so decided to do some of the unfinished plumbing (before the spouse
      finds something to keep me busy).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whistle valve will
      finish off the shelf above the rear cylinder and the whistle will help with
      laying out the right running board.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Some months ago I learned that the air tank on the right side of
      Kenneth's locomotive was really a whistle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then read The Whistle chapter in <u>SO YOU
      WANT TO BUILD A LIVE STEAM LOCOMOTIVE</u>&nbsp; (referred to as the text
      in the following description) and learned that whistle
      can't be scaled without raising the pitch.&nbsp; A design using a
      1.5&quot; piece of thin-wall plumbing pipe about 10 inches long is
      presented and seems to match the design used by Kenneth.&nbsp; Castings
      for this whistle are available from Coles.&nbsp; This design
      divides the tube into four sections of different lengths to make a four
      tone or four chime whistle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overall whistle length determines the
      lowest frequency tone.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tube diameter is related to
      the whistle volume.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Next, some photos of the the Cass Shays were examined to try to
      determine the size of the air tank.&nbsp; The next photo shows the tank on
      Cass 5, which scales to about 10 inches long and a little
      over 2 inches diameter.</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Cass5A.jpg" width="700" height="430"></p>
      <p>The next step was to check out the various tone combinations listed in
      the text and to select one for the Shay whistle.&nbsp; I tried some of the variations of the 4-chime
      cords on the organ.&nbsp; Have to
      admit that none sounded very good and none sounded like a whistle.&nbsp; (
      I'm tone deaf so not surprised with this result.)&nbsp; The whistle
      chapter was written by J F Nelson and he mentioned experimenting with
      variations so decided that the whistle listed as the one he used would be
      a reliable choice.&nbsp; The tones and tube lengths for J F Nelson's
      whistle are:</p>

      <p>The text mentions that these lengths are correct for steam.&nbsp;
      (Suspect that if you try formulas from your old college physics text that
      are for air you'll get different lengths.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>So, the whistle will be about 10&quot; long including the throat
      assembly ----- a close match to the air tank on Cass 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      next task was to determine the diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted
      to make it about 2&quot; diameter but suffered sticker shock when checking
      out the price of 2&quot; OD brass tubes.&nbsp; And then there's the
      brass rod needed to make the&nbsp; throat assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some brass
      strips are also needed for the vanes inside of the tube; the strip width
      the same as the tube OD.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was designing a steam powered water
      pump at the same time as I was working on the whistle and had decided to
      use some 2&quot; OD brass rod (~$40 a foot) and 2&quot; X 1/8&quot; brass strips for the
      pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found
      a 2&quot; OD - 1 7/8&quot; ID stainless steel tube from McMaster-Carr for
      about $12 so decided to go with a 2&quot; OD whistle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Those of you with Nelson's text can refer to the drawings in The
      Whistle chapter.&nbsp; I don't want to reproduce those drawings here as
      it'd likely violate the copyright.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, that text is a
      wealth of information for us novices so advise you all to go buy
      one.&nbsp; In place of the drawing I'll show the sub assemblies first and
      then show how some of the pieces were fabricated.&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="left">The vanes and the ends are made from the 2&quot; X&nbsp;1/8&quot;
    strip.&nbsp; The tube is&nbsp; 2&quot; OD Stainless steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    vane assembly is pressed into the tube and the throat (on the
    left)&nbsp; is screwed onto the end of the vane assembly.&nbsp; The throat
    is turned from 2&quot; OD brass rod.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hole in the throat is
    threaded 3/8&quot;-24&nbsp; matching the 1&quot; long stud on the end of the
    vane assembly. The throat&nbsp; is 7/8&quot; long with a 1.67&quot; diameter recess
    bored 7/16&quot; deep.&nbsp; The nipple is 1/4&quot; MTP.&nbsp; The left
    1/2&quot; of the vane assembly is turned to 1.66&quot; (0.10&quot; less than
    the recess in the throat ) with the end plate turned at a 45 degree angle.&nbsp;

    <p>The next step was to press the vane assembly into the tube.&nbsp; I used
    a 0.001&quot; interference ----not much.&nbsp; The plan was to use a little Loctite
    if it was loose.&nbsp;&nbsp; I heated the tube to 400 degrees in the oven,
    held it with a thick towel and slid the vane into position.&nbsp; After the
    tube cooled (or vanes warmed) the vane was held firmly.&nbsp; The throat was then screwed on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            turned from a Delrin scrap.&nbsp;&nbsp; The elbow next to the whistle
            has a small hole (#56 drill) as per the text.&nbsp; The hole is to

            <p>The whistle sounded really good on air after the throat was adjusted (it
    drove the workshop cat into hiding and brought the spouse from the other end

    indicated&nbsp; the whistle sounds better on steam than air.&nbsp; Maybe I
    screwed up and this one will sound better on air.&nbsp;&nbsp;
