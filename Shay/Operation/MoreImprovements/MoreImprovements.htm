      <p>The shay is near the end of the second summer operation and for the most part it 
      has run very well.&nbsp; Most of my time and energy are now spent on the 
      design and construction of the Heisler.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the Heisler 
      design is based on the Shay and as such I frequently ask myself is there 
      is a better way.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has lead me to go back and make a couple 
      changes in the Shay, one is the use of quick connects on the water hoses ( 
      a minor change with a major convenience improvement) and a redesign of the 
      fire 
      pan&nbsp; which significantly improved the performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <hr>
        <p><b>Water Hose Quick Connects:&nbsp; </b>The water hose connections 
        under the tender used 1/4&quot; OD tube compression fittings with the tube 
        shoved into the end of the hose.&nbsp;&nbsp; These worked great most the 
        time.&nbsp; However, once in a while I over tightened the nut.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        When I then tried to loosen the nut the fitting or the nipple 
        through the tank floor started to unscrew.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then had to get 
        out a second wrench and try to hold the compression fitting while 
        unscrewing the compression nut.&nbsp;&nbsp; One day when out at the 
        track I noticed one of the guys had small quick connects in the water 
        lines.&nbsp; I asked him about them and he said they were hydraulic 
        quick connects.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later I asked Dick McCoy what he used and he 
        said he used the small hydraulic quick connects and also used a small 
        coolant quick connect.&nbsp; The coolant quick connects however don't 
        seal the line when disconnecting.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said McMaster-Carr 
        carries several types of quick connects. </p>

            the stud which eliminates the need for a separate drain valve.&nbsp; 
            Next time I'll use a 1/4&quot; NPT nipple through the tank bottom to 
            increase the flow when draining the tank.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

        <p align="left"><b>New Fire Pan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The burner  
        ran pretty well.&nbsp; There were however several things I wished were 
        different:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        <p align="left">It was impossible to maintain a low heat level.&nbsp; At 
        the lowest setting the safety valves would be&nbsp; relieving when 
        running slow on a flat track.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left">I seemed to need too much blower on high settings to 
        keep from smoking (a smoking oil fire caused the tubes to collect soot 
        quickly).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left">The spark plug didn't seem to relight the fire as easily 
        as other oil burners I'd observed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left">I was working on the Heisler design and was 
        investigating various superheater alternatives.&nbsp; I was leaning 
        heavily toward a heat exchanger in the top of the firebox.&nbsp; Ken 
        Schroeder advised that his experience was that smoke box superheaters 
        didn't work very well.&nbsp; (He said he'd had good results with 
        superheater tubes in the boiler tubes and fair results with the 
        superheater tubes in the firebox.)&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left">Being an engineer, I decided it was wise to try to obtain 
        some data.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over Labor Day Dan Staron was running his propane 
        fired Shay and I had my oil burner on the track.&nbsp;&nbsp; (We did a 
        shay pull to see which was the more powerful.&nbsp; That wasn't any fun; 
        they seemed to be exactly matched)&nbsp;&nbsp; I used a little IR 
        thermometer to measure a few temperatures after the shays had been operating a 
        while at ~ 100 psi.&nbsp; The non insulated&nbsp; boiler in the firebox 
        area measured about 340 degrees (F) as expected.&nbsp; The smoke boxes 
        were hotter and the maximum temperature was around the base of the 
        smokestack.&nbsp; My oil burner measured about 460 and Dan's propane 
        burner measured about 490.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left">I figured the hotter the smoke stack, the hotter the 
        flue gases and the better a smoke box superheater would work. So, later 
        at home I fooled around a bit and found that if I ran the blower really 
        high I could get the smokestack temperature to about 550 degrees.&nbsp; 
        (I knew I could make the oil burner out perform&nbsp; that&nbsp; propane 
        burner.) I couldn't get a good reading on the flue gases but did get a 
        few indications over 650 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the flues gases are 
        really that hot, a smoke box superheater should work great.</p>
        <p align="left">Another piece of data ..... Dick McCloy and Dan Staron 
        were watching one day when I was fooling with the blower to get rid of 
        the smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; They noted how the fire seemed very sensitive to 
        the amount of air for combustion.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggested that if I 
        opened the firebox door, more air would be supplied and the smoke would 
        go away.&nbsp; The opposite happened, when I opened the door there was more smoke and I needed more 
        blower to get rid of the smoke.&nbsp; It was then obvious that air entering 
        the firebox door wasn't used in combustion.</p>
        <p align="left">So, thinking about all the data I wondered how 
        to get the optimum fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I now knew that air entering 
        the fire box door and likely air entering the back of the fire pan wouldn't 
        help combustion.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had earlier cut a hole near the rear of 
        the fire pan and installed a damper over the hole.&nbsp; Experimentation 
        showed that the best fire was with that damper closed but it didn't seal 
        perfectly so I should probably seal that hole.&nbsp; I concluded that 
        the air&nbsp; entering around the nozzle was the air used in 
        combustion.&nbsp;&nbsp; It then seemed obvious that I could get more 
        combustion air either by increasing the blower or making a bigger 
        opening around the nozzle.&nbsp; Then I recalled the oil burner on the 
        Heisler at Mt Rainier Scenic Railroad.&nbsp; That fire pan is sealed 
        except for a louvered opening around the nozzle; see
        <a href="../../../Heisler/RefBoiler/MRSR91Burner/MRSR91Burner.htm">MRSR 
        91 Burner</a>. </p>
        <p align="left">The next step was obvious, make a new fire pan that was 
        sealed except for an opening around the nozzle.&nbsp; Make the opening 
        around the nozzle bigger than before ( about X 3) and put&nbsp; a damper 
        on that opening.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left">The next photo shows a side view of the new fire pan.&nbsp; 
        It's a bit crude --- this was an experiment.&nbsp; I figured to learn a 
        bit more and then make a nice final design.&nbsp; The pan extends into 
        the fire box about 3/4&quot;&nbsp; on the sides and back.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        bottom of the pan slopes up front to back.&nbsp; The front extends down 
        about 1.75&quot; </p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="FP1.jpg" width="699" height="312"></p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="FP2.jpg" width="699" height="293"></p>
        <p align="left">All available area in the back is open except for about 
        0.5&quot; on the sides and the nozzle mount.&nbsp; The damper is a rotating 
        flap&nbsp; show in the open position above and closed position below.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="FP3.jpg" width="700" height="295"></p>
        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="FP4.jpg" width="700" height="485"></p>
        <p align="left">The photo above shows the inside of the pan.&nbsp; That 
        is refractory cement used to insulate the pan.&nbsp; The spark plug is 
        inside a cylinder welded to the bottom of the pan.&nbsp; I didn't have 
        the correct tap for the plug so I made it a sliding fit and have a 
        retaining plate on the bottom to hold it in place. </p>
        <p align="left">So how did it work?&nbsp;&nbsp; Great!</p>
        <p align="left">When&nbsp; the damper is closed, a very low fire can be 
        maintained with very low blower settings.&nbsp; As the fuel feed is 
        increased, the damper can be adjusted in conjunction with the blower to 
        get a stable burn with no smoke. Too much air cases the flame to be 
        unstable --- too little gives smoke.&nbsp; I was able to get at least 
        25% more fuel feed than before at a lower blower setting and no smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left">There is a&nbsp; maximum fire than can be maintained.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        What happens as the fuel, air feed (damper) and blower are&nbsp; increased,&nbsp; 
        there is a point where the fire starts to shoot out the small observation 
        hole in the fire box door and also out around the nozzle.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The flames shooting out any opening reminded me of flames shooting out 
        around a crucible at&nbsp; the aluminum foundry I once worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Small flames shooting out probably won't cause any problem except if the 
        engineer reaches down to the blow down valve handle with an ungloved 
        hand.&nbsp; In normal operation a much lower burner setting would be 
        used. </p>
        <p align="left">The fist test at the track went great.&nbsp; I was able 
        to pull a much heavier load up grades at a greater speed than before 
        while maintaining steam pressure. (The only thing that marred the day 
        was that I had some dirty fuel that plugged the filter a couple times.)</p>
        <p align="left">The burner now relights with the spark plug much easier 
        than before.&nbsp; Sometimes I have to make it a little rich to get  it 
        to start. </p>
        <p align="left">I of course was taking smokestack temperatures along the 
        way and found the temperature was much lower than before.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        About 400 degrees under most conditions and a maximum of about 500 
        degrees after running the burner with flames shooting out everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This means that there is more heat transfer to the water( mainly in the 
        firebox) and less heat up the smokestack.&nbsp; It also means that the 
        temperature differential in the smoke box is probably too small to make 
        a good smoke box superheater just like Ken Schroeder already told me.</p>
        <p align="left">I now remember the first time I fired up the Shay Dan 
        Staron observed that too much heat seemed to be going up the stack.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        It's now obvious that he was right.&nbsp; The object should not be a hot 
        stack, it should be the hottest&nbsp; firebox&nbsp; possible with the 
        coolest stack possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a meet in a few weeks where 
        there'll probably be a half dozen coal fired steamers that operate very 
        well.&nbsp; I'm anxious to take a few smokestack temperature 
        measurements for comparison.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left">The fire pan worked so well that I probably won't make 
        another that has a better appearance. One thing remaining is to make a 
        control in the cab for the damper.&nbsp;&nbsp; I now leave it set about 
        75% open which is good for most operation.&nbsp; If I want to turn the 
        burner way down when sitting I can reach down and close the damper all 
        the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; The control will be probably similar the one used 
        on <a href="../../../Heisler/RefBoiler/MRSR91Burner/MRSR91Burner.htm">
        MRSR 91</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Update 10/23/2006:&nbsp; </b>This fire pan was 
        modified by removing the variable damper and installed a mixing chamber;
