        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">After the first run there
        were a number of items that needed improved or fixed.&nbsp; That will
        probably be the case for the first half dozen runs.&nbsp; This page
        describes these changes.&nbsp; The changes are also included on the
        pages that describe the construction of the specific
        part.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Blower:&nbsp; </b>The
      biggest problem on the first run was that sufficient steam couldn't be
      generated on long grades.&nbsp; Also, there was some buildup of soot in the
      tubes.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the run the blower was checked by connecting
      compressed air to the boiler, opening the blower valve and observing the
      air flow out of the stack .&nbsp; There was very little air
      flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; The smoke box front was removed and the blower holes
      were examined.&nbsp; Several were blocked or restricted.&nbsp; This had
      happened before so there seemed to be a design problem.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Kenneth had specified four
      1/32&quot; (0.032&quot;) holes for the blower working with his propane
      burner.&nbsp;&nbsp; I recalled reading someplace that a good design for coal
      burners in six 1/16&quot; holes.&nbsp; I think that was for larger
      locomotives than the 60 ton shay.&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked up Bob Reedy's
      design for his Three Truck Climax&nbsp; (July/August 2003 <u>Live Steam</u>
      ) and found that he used four #55 drill (0.052&quot;) holes.&nbsp; Recall
      that I had copied Reedy's burner design so using the same size blower
      holes seemed appropriate.&nbsp; The exhaust nozzle was removed and the
      holes enlarged to 0.052&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">What a difference!&nbsp; The expanded holes gives much
      more draft.&nbsp; With the less obstructive fuel filter installed a few
      weeks earlier,&nbsp; the burner has a much wider range of heat without
      smoking.&nbsp;&nbsp; The maximum heat output seemed to be maybe twice as
      much as before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The blower is functional over a much wider range of blower
      pressures so the pressure gauge on the blower&nbsp; line was changed from
      30 psi full scale to 60 psi full scale.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">A second run at the track confirmed that this change to the blower fixed the steaming problem.</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Tube Brush:&nbsp; </b>The tubes had a soot build up so
      I asked Dave Johnson what he used to clean his tubes.&nbsp; He suggested a
      shotgun bore brush (Wal-Mart) connected to a long rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The end of the brush is
      threaded close to 5/16-24 --- maybe a metric thread.&nbsp; A 5/16-24 die
      was run over the thread to make it exactly 5/16-24.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rod is
      1/8&quot; diameter&nbsp; steel -- it must be flexible enough to bend
      around the exhaust nozzle to get to the lower tubes.&nbsp;&nbsp; A piece
      of 3/8&quot; brass rod was drilled 1/8&quot; on one end and drilled &amp;
      tapped 5/16-24 on the other end.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rod was then silver
      soldered to the end of the 1/8&quot; rod.&nbsp;&nbsp; The handle&nbsp; is 1/4&quot;
      brass that is also silver soldered to the
      rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

              the nozzle in place.&nbsp; After brushing,&nbsp; soot was
              collected

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Lubricator:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>There were several problems
      with the lubricator:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The 1/8&quot; filler pipe was too small --- the oil
          stuck to the side plugging the pipe making it impossible to fill.&nbsp;</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The 1/8&quot; MTP union connecting the lubricator line to
          the steam header was too difficult to connect and disconnect.</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The check valve failed again allowing steam to back up
          into the lubricator.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The input pipe was changed from 1/8&quot; pipe to
      3/8&quot; pipe, which made it very easy to fill.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I did a bit of research on manufactured lubricators and found
      that <a href="http://www.locoparts.net/">Loco Parts</a> makes a lubricator
      check valve combined with a right angle fitting that connects to the steam
      chest.&nbsp; This fitting is 1/8&quot; NPT on the steam chest side and
      1/8&quot; tube compression fitting on the input side.&nbsp; I also noticed
      that some of locomotives at MCC had an external check valve in
      addition to the one in the lubricator so others may have had the same
      check valve problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">One concern&nbsp; with using a&nbsp; 1/8&quot; tube
      compression to 1/8&quot; NPT elbow at the stream header was that the
      1/8&quot; pipe size would seem way out of scale on the little shay.&nbsp;
      I found a 1/8&quot; tube compression to 1/16&quot; NPT elbow at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mcmaster.com/">McMaster-Carr</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      --- part # 5053K57.&nbsp; This fitting is sold as &quot;quick
      assembly&quot; and comes with a combined compression nut and sleeve.&nbsp;
      The standard nuts and sleeves will also work with the
      elbow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that 1/16&quot; NPT is the same thread as
      5/16&quot; MTP ---- buy the 1/16&quot; NPT taps and dies,&nbsp; they are 20% the
      cost of the MTP taps and dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I decided to switch from steel balls to poppet type check
      valves using O-Rings to see if they sealed any better.&nbsp; The Buna N
      O-Rings were selected&nbsp; because they are compatible with oil.&nbsp;
      The 250 degree max temperature will be OK at the lubricator end but will
      be pushing it at the&nbsp; steam header end.&nbsp; If the O-Ring at that
      end fails I'll replace it with a Viton O-Ring.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">For the lubricator end, the&nbsp; #103 O-Ring (3/32&quot;
      ID, 1/16&quot; cross section) was selected along with a 5/8&quot; long
      0.24&quot; OD,&nbsp; 0.026&quot;&nbsp; wire size stainless steel
      compression spring.&nbsp; Both McMaster-Carr&nbsp; and <a href="http://www.mscdirect.com">MSC&nbsp;</a>
      sell packages of&nbsp; 5 precision compression springs for less than
      $5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The one used here is McMaster part number 9435K39 which
      they list on the website for $9.73.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the item is added to
      the shopping cart it shows up as $4 something.&nbsp; Recall that the lubricator was
      originally made with a 3/16&quot; bore and the bottom part with the check
      ball was drilled 5/16&quot; and tapped 3/8-24.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the
      upper part of the bore was sleeved&nbsp; and reduced to 1/8&quot; to
      reduce oil output.&nbsp; If the lubricator was originally designed for
      1/8&quot; bore then the smaller poppet made for the steam header end would
      also be suitable for the lubricator
      end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The # 003 O-Ring (0.056&quot; actual ID, 0.176&quot; actual
      OD) and a 1/2&quot; long 0.18&quot; OD, 0.018&quot; wire spring (McMaster
      # 9435K24) were selected for the steam header check
      valve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      <hr>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Steam Powered Water Pump:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The pump
      started to run really slow.&nbsp; A few drops of silicone brake fluid in
      the steam line speeded it up
      for a few minutes but then it slowed down again.&nbsp; A lubricator seemed
      like a real pain.&nbsp; The pump was disassembled and the steam piston was found to be hard to push. A little water made it easier to push
      but still pretty tight.&nbsp;&nbsp; The depth of the gland was according
      to specifications --- but that was for a tight seal.&nbsp; For this
      application a slight leak is tolerable so the gland depth was increased
      to 0.100&quot; --- a loose seal for the 0.103&quot; O-Ring cross
      section.&nbsp; That seemed to fix the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
      this fix I also had problems with the pilot valve rod and the connection
      between the shuttle valve pistons working loose.&nbsp; I finally bit the
      bullet and took apart each joint and applied high temperature Loctite
      (620) .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Loctite seems to have fixed that
      problem.</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Brakes:</b> The brakes seemed very slow to operate on the first
      run at the track.&nbsp; The valve was also leaking.&nbsp; Turns out that
      the O-Ring on the input steam line was cut, torn &amp;
      pulverized.&nbsp;&nbsp; That explains the leak and loss of pressure.&nbsp;
      A new O-Ring was installed and the brakes then responded very quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      pressure on the O-Ring may have been too great so the screws attaching the
      cover were left a little loose which also made the valve operate
      smoother.&nbsp;&nbsp; The valve is functional but not&nbsp; up
      to expectations so a redesign on the list.</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Footboards:&nbsp;</b> The footboards below the front
      and rear sills were raised a half inch to avoid catching on things along the
      track. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Foot Pegs:&nbsp; </b>A temporary set of foot pegs had
      been installed to test the peg position&nbsp; The pegs were fastened to the lower angles on the middle truck
      and were positioned about
      2 inches in front of the middle truck and about 1&quot; above the rail
      head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The position was good but so low that it was
      likely that they would hit things along the track such as
      switches.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't particularly like fasting the pegs to the
      truck either.&nbsp;</font></p>

      store.&nbsp; The bolts holding the pegs to the rod are 1/4&quot; stainless
      with Nyloc nuts.&nbsp; A 1/8&quot; thick shim was tack welded inside each
      tube to make up the difference between the the 5/8&quot; tube inside
      dimension and the
      1/2&quot; rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hangers were made of 1/2&quot;
      angle and attached to the rod with 10-32 screws.&nbsp; The hangers attach
      to the inside of the frame a couple inches ahead of the middle
      truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; The top of the hangers were&nbsp; shaped to get around other
      stuff on the inside of the frame.&nbsp; The left hanger is fitted around
      the low pressure return water line from the axel pump return valve (this
      line also feeds the steam powered pump).&nbsp;&nbsp; The cutout top of the
      right hanger is to provide clearance for the two water hoses connecting to
      the axel pump.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notches in the side of the hangers
      just above the rod are for the inside trust rods &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial"><b>Seat: </b>Dick McCloy lent me a bass boat seat from Wal-Mart to try out
      for size.&nbsp; It seemed to work pretty well so I bought my very
      own.&nbsp; The selection of colors were gray with blue trim and gray with
      blue trim.&nbsp;&nbsp; A piece of old carpet was cut to the width of
      the&nbsp; tank top&nbsp; and one end screwed to the bottom of the seat.&nbsp; The
      carpet was then folded&nbsp; to make a double thickness&nbsp; and to
      protect the tender top from the screw heads.&nbsp; The seat just sets on
      the tender.&nbsp; The sides of the tender that stick above the tender top
      retain the carpet (and seat) from moving side to side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      seat can slide several inches front to back, limited by the lamp at the
      rear and the carpet running into the filler hatch in the
      front.&nbsp;&nbsp; The front part of the seat&nbsp; is over the filler
      hatch so the seat must be tilted back to add water or use the hand
      pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next photo shows the shay ready for use with
      engineer's seat,&nbsp; smokestack extension and cab roof
      raised.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cup holder and rear view mirror have been
      deferred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

              was to judge the correct speed.&nbsp; The shays were capable of
              pulling a relatively heavy load for their size but traveled very slow,
              typically less than 10 mph.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several of the guys
              suggested that I install a bicycle speedometer to measure both
              speed and distance.&nbsp;</font>

              shay wheels are too large so I cobbled up the adaptor on the
              right.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a hose clamp, 4-40 screw, the magnet
              attached and a piece of 3/4&quot; steel&nbsp; rod simulating a shay axel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The hose clamp is much larger than required -- it was all I had

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Drying the Engineer:&nbsp; </b>The engine exhaust has
        a low point directly under the smokestack.&nbsp; During the warm up
        period,&nbsp; steam that leaks past the throttle valve heats the
        cylinders and headers (good) and condenses in the exhaust pipe
        (bad).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the steam powered pump is used during this
        period, additional water collects.&nbsp; When the throttle is opened
        initially, the oil laced water shoots out the smoke stack and lands on
        the engineer.&nbsp; and everything else within a 6 foot radius.&nbsp; Once the engine is hot,&nbsp; most the steam and oil
        passes over the engineer and lands on any passengers --- a good design.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">So, the biggest problem is the water collected during
      warm up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I drilled a 3/32&quot; hole in the bottom of the
      exhaust pipe directly under the stack to drain this
      condensate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I'd thought to drill the hole when
      I had the exhaust nozzle out to enlarge the blower holes, it would have
      been a small task.&nbsp; However, it was too late for that.&nbsp; I then
      remembered some long aircraft bits purchased years ago from a surplus
      store. .&nbsp; The smallest was 3/32&quot; which set the hole
      size.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulled the smokestack and ran the drill down the
      smokestack hole, through the exhaust nozzle and drilled the hole through
      the bottom of the exhaust pipe elbow.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The hole really worked.&nbsp; During warm up there was a
      steady dribble of oily water out of the hole.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once it was hot,
      the hole continued to drip with a significant oil content.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The hole probably causes some loss of draft, but not so
      much that it was noticeable. &nbsp;</font></p>
      <hr>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Valve Timing: </b>The shay ran much better at the second
        test run at the track.&nbsp; Enlarging the blower holes seemed to have
        fixed the problem with generating steam.&nbsp; The next area to look at
        was the valve adjustment to see if the engine was running at good
        efficiency. I had suspected the timing needed some attention but decided
        to try out the blower fix and then work on the timing so as to get a
        separate ,measure of each modification.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The engine must be removed to get at the timing
      adjustments.&nbsp; It takes less than 5 minutes to disconnect the reverse
      link, the flanges at the input and exhaust headers and the 4 screws
      holding the mount to the frame.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The front cylinder must be removed to get at the middle
      cylinder steam chest cover.&nbsp; That front cylinder was removed and then
      the timing of both the middle and rear cylinders examined.&nbsp; The
      timing was off quite a bit.&nbsp; It was probably not set accurately
      during the reassembly after painting.&nbsp; Most the eccentric straps were
      loose which introduced slack and delay.&nbsp;&nbsp; The straps were very
      tight when first installed --- so tight that they were run with loose
      screws for a while.&nbsp; (The engine has had at least 100 hours of
      operation on the test stand so the wear is due to that more than the half dozen
      hours at the track.)&nbsp; The straps were made tight again by filing a
      very small amount off the surface between the two halves of the
      straps.&nbsp;&nbsp; The timing was then set so that the amount of opening
      (lead) was the same at top and bottom dead center in both forward and
      reverse.&nbsp; Ken suggests that the valve should start to open at about
      10 degrees before top/bottom dead center.&nbsp; I found that it didn't
      start to open till about&nbsp; top dead center --- about 10 degrees later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The valve chapter in Joseph Nelson's <u>So You Want to
      Build a Live Steam Locomotive</u>&nbsp; seemed really boring before but
      now was very interesting and useful.&nbsp; The fact that the valves
      weren't open at dead center meant that there was essentially no
      lead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead is useful since it provides some compensation for
      wear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph suggests a 1/32&quot;
      lead&nbsp;(valve open 1/32&quot; at dead center).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The engine was the first part constructed and it's likely
      that the dimensions are not exact.&nbsp; One good point is that the valves
      on the middle and rear cylinder seemed to have essentially no lead when
      the valve was adjusted so that it was balanced top and bottom and forward
      and reverse.&nbsp; Also, the position in these four states were very
      close.&nbsp; To get a little more lead it seemed that the the eccentrics
      should be advanced.&nbsp; I probably should have made a set of those valve
      diagrams described by Joseph Nelson.&nbsp; Instead I looked up Kozo
      Hiraoka's eccentrics in <u>Building the Shay</u> .&nbsp; Hiraoka has his
      eccentrics peak 109 degrees ahead of the crank peak (that is 19 degrees
      above the horizontal when the crank is at the bottom center).&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Kenneth has the eccentric peaking 100 degrees ahead of the crank (10
      degrees above the horizontal when the crank is at bottom center).&nbsp; I
      decided to try a 105 degree advance (15 degrees above horizontal) on one
      of the cylinders.&nbsp; That gave some lead in all four states (top &amp;
      bottom dead center&nbsp; in forward &amp; reverse).&nbsp; The valve
      doesn't open in all states 10 degrees ahead of dead center as suggested by
      Kenneth ---- maybe an average of 5 degrees ahead of center.&nbsp; I failed
      to measure the lead&nbsp; but suspect it averages less than the 1/32&quot;
      suggested by Joseph Nelson.&nbsp; The other two cylinders were also
      adjusted the same way with similar
      results.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">So ----- what kind of a difference will these timing changes
      make?&nbsp; I had a week or so to think about it before I made it to the
      track.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to have more power on the test stand.&nbsp;
      One test I made was to determine the throttle setting at which I couldn't
      stop the engine with my two hands grasping the shafts. This seemed
      to be a significantly lower setting than before.&nbsp; The conclusion was much more power ---
      50% more and possibly twice the power.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The test run confirmed that it is much more efficient
      ----- 50% to 100 % more so.&nbsp; The shay&nbsp; was able to pull two cars, one loaded with
      logs and another with one person up a ~ 100 yard long 3% grade at &gt;20 mph
      (scale ) and keep pressure such that the safety relief was open the whole
      whole time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The shay is essentially complete and&nbsp; exceeds expectations.&nbsp; More tests with greater loads will be done over the
      summer&nbsp; and no doubt more improvements will be made.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Engineer experience will likely bring the greatest improvements. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
