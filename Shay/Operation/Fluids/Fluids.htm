      <p>As the day that the locomotive would be running approached I started to
      think about operational details.&nbsp; Recall that I'd never actually run
      a live steam locomotive so I started to collect information from others
      and to be more observant when others fired up and ran their steamers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It soon became apparent that there was much
      more information than I could remember so I started to write it
      down.&nbsp; Several others asked what lubricant or boiler treatment I was
      going to use (like I knew what I was doing) so I decided to put together
      this webpage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Lubrication: </b>There are a number of lubrication passages in the engine and drive
      train.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not like your
      auto where you can go to the local auto parts store or can check the
      maintenance manual.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had concluded that light motor oil
      should work for the bearings, etc. and I had already purchased a
      small bottle of steam cylinder oil for the lubricator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Being a novice, Kenneth's advice was solicited.&nbsp; His response was:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p><i>I use Chevron Vistac 68 for the cross heads and any sliding part.&nbsp;
      This is the same oil I use on the bed of my lathe and Mill.&nbsp; It is a
      real tacky oil and sticks well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>
      <p><i>For the u-joints and rotating parts I use&nbsp;hydraulic oil&nbsp;46.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Chevron used to make both turbine oil and hydraulic oil but&nbsp;discontinued
      their turbine oil years ago because they said it was the same as their
      hydraulic oil.&nbsp; They said that the two oils were almost&nbsp;one in
      the same, just with different labels, at least that is what the
      distributor told me.&nbsp;</i></p>
      <p>Kenneth's advice made a lot of sense.&nbsp; Chevron products
      aren't common in the eastern US so I went to&nbsp; webpage&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ccoilco.com/webpage/crossreference.html">http://www.ccoilco.com/webpage/crossreference.html</a>
      to find equivalents for Vistac.&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that Vistac is
      a Way Oil like I had used on the lathe bed and mill column.&nbsp; It's good
      for sliding surfaces as suggested by Kenneth.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried
      the local machine tool supply shop and found they didn't carry
      Way Oil so I checked McMaster- Carr online.&nbsp; They have the following descriptive information at the start of their section on lubricating
      oil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <td vAlign="top" width="51%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viscosity
            is the thickness, or resistance to flow, of an oil. Various
            organizations have different scales on which oil viscosity is
            measured. The <b>International Organization for Standardization
            (ISO) </b>assigns an ISO grade number. Oils with higher numbers are
            thicker than those with lower numbers. The <b>Saybolt Universal
            Seconds (SUS) </b>viscosity test measures the number of seconds it
            takes for 60 cc (cubic centimeters) of oil to flow through a
            specified diameter hole. The <b>American Gear Manufacturers
            Association (AGMA) </b>has its own grading system specific to
            industrial gear oil.</td>
          <td vAlign="top" width="49%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additives
            help improve specific characteristics of an oil, such as load
            capacity and corrosion resistance. <b>Detergent additives </b>help
            prevent sludge and other engine deposits by keeping unwanted
            particles suspended in the oil. These suspended particles are later
            removed when the oil passes through a filter. Detergents are most
            commonly found in engine oils. <b>Nondetergent oils </b>are used
            where sludge formation is not a problem or with other additives,
            such as oxidation inhibitors, to combat contamination.</td>

      <p><b>Steam Cylinder Oil:&nbsp; </b>A pint of steam
      cylinder had been purchased some time ago but never opened. &nbsp; The
      lubricator was finished by installing the 1/8&quot; output tube to the steam header.&nbsp;
      The next thing was to add the steam oil.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pump
      had been tested with some
      motor oil&nbsp; so the the really thick steam seemed strange.&nbsp; The
      engine was started on compressed air to observe the pump action which
      turned out to be big bubbles up through the thick oil in the lubricator
      tank.&nbsp; The output tube was then disconnected from the header and the engine
      run again.&nbsp; The
      bubbling stopped and the oil made it to the end of the tube after a short
      period.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem was that oil wouldn't flow into the pump
      cylinder when the output pipe was pressurized with air --- the little ball check in
      the pump output probably leaked under air pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When running the locomotive on the test stand in the basement workshop
      (powered by compressed air) I wondered where the steam cylinder oil went.&nbsp; I
      held my hand over the smokestack and didn't find the exhaust air to be
      oily (probably good news in the basement).&nbsp; A few hours later I
      noticed a few drops on the floor under the smoke box so the oil must have
      made it through the cylinders and then ran down the exhaust pipe to the
      smoke box which served as a separator.&nbsp;&nbsp; When powered by steam I
      assume the oil will mix with the steam, exit the smokestack and be
      deposited on the engineer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I later determined the the
      pump was supplying about twice the oil it should.&nbsp; The pump was
      modified.)</p>
      <p>The pint of oil on hand will run out at some point so a source of a larger more economical quantity was desired.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An&nbsp; Internet search on <i>steam cylinder oil</i> 
      turned up a nice article on steam cylinder oil for novice live steamers at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.southernsteamtrains.com/notes/steam%20oil.htm">http://www.southernsteamtrains.com/notes/steam%20oil.htm</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      One of the points made in the article is that steam cylinder oil must
      contain some animal oil (tallow) to allow it to mix with the steam. The
      point was also made that the lower pressure steam (~100 psi) should have a
      different formulation that the higher pressure (~200 psi) full size engine
      because 100 psi steam is about 340 degrees F and 200 psi steam is hotter
      at about 390 degrees F.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The webpage for Green Velvet Steam Cylinder Oil (<a href="http://www.steamenginelube.com/">http://www.steamenginelube.com/
      </a>) was next.&nbsp; Of interest&nbsp; is their 5 page note on the history of steam oil
      at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.steamenginelube.com/PDFdocuments/SpecificationsandHowtoread.pdf">http://www.steamenginelube.com/PDFdocuments/SpecificationsandHowtoread.pdf</a>.&nbsp;
      They stress the importance of using Pennsylvania grade oil (paraffin
      based) with beef tallow additive for a steam cylinder oil.&nbsp; (Note that
      our Ohio oil is the same type as Pennsylvania grade.)&nbsp;
      They also
      mention the similarity between gear oil and steam cylinder oil with the point
      that the tallow is missing from gear oil.&nbsp; For lower
      temperature wet steam they&nbsp; recommend 10% additives (I assume the additives
      are mostly
      tallow) while for higher pressure dry steam like found in the full sized
      locomotives they recommend 5% additives.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.steamenginelube.com/PDFdocuments/SaponAMaxformone.pdf" target="_blank">Sapon-A-Max
      Formula 1 ISO460&nbsp;</a> (click for info) is the product they recommend for
      lower pressure wet steam found in the small live steam locomotive.&nbsp;
      Green Velvet sells the oil in quarts, half gallons, gallons, five gallons
      , drums, etc and will accept credit cards.&nbsp; The current (2003) price
      including shipping to anyplace in the US is $34.14 for one gallon and
      $111.28 for 5 gallons.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>WD40: </b>I don't know whether WD40 is a lubricant (WD stands for
      water displacement) but decided to include it here for
      completeness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cylinder head drawing contains a suggestion that 1/4&quot; MTP holes be made in the center of the upper
      cylinder heads.&nbsp; The holes are normally plugged.&nbsp; A quote from
      Kenneth: <i>The one thing that is important is to pull the plug in the
      cylinder heads after running on steam and shooting some WD40 into the
      cylinder to keep the piston rings free and from sticking to the cylinder
      walls.&nbsp;&nbsp; I generally roll the engine back and forth on its stand&nbsp;a
      couple of times,&nbsp;a day or two apart after putting the WD40 into the
      cylinders.&nbsp; &nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</p>

            <td>&nbsp;I had neglected to make those center holes in the
              heads&nbsp; because I didn't have a
      1/4&quot; MTP tap when the heads were fabricated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I have
              a tap I decided that a 1/4&quot;
      hole looks a little oversize so I went with a 6-32 hole and used hex
      head screws with copper washers for the plugs.&nbsp; If the holes prove
      too small, they can be enlarged later.&nbsp;&nbsp;The plug for
      the rear cylinder is under the shelf so an access hole was drilled in the
      shelf.&nbsp; A screw with a ~1&quot; high head that sticks through the
      hole in the shelf was made from a piece of 1/4&quot; brass hex bar.&nbsp;
              That rear cylinder plug is just in front of the steam brake valve
              as shown in the photo at the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
