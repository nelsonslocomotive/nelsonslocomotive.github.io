      <p align="left">The Shay is ready for the first run at the
      track.&nbsp;&nbsp; But first, the ~ 500 pounds must be moved from the
      basement workshop to the track.&nbsp; I've put together this page to show
      at least one way to do the transport.&nbsp; Recall that I'm a novice so
      this was all new to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              SUV.&nbsp; The back seats will be folded down to make room for the
              equipment.&nbsp; The first step was to put together some tracks; a longer track
              for the engine and a short track for the tender.&nbsp; The tracks
              were made from 2X4s as shown in the photo. The front of the longer
              track rests on the folded down right seat back.&nbsp;<b> </b>The
              2X4 at the very rear is beyond the 2X4 tracks to support the
              loading/unloading track.&nbsp;&nbsp; The center cross 2X4 is
              lodged against the seat back hinges to keep to from sliding
              forward.&nbsp;</td>

              move the shay from the basement workshop to the driveway.&nbsp;
              There is a walkway from the basement outside entrance around the
              house to a small deck at the front.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving the shay on
              the hydraulic table was no big problem except for the effort to push
              the ~600 pounds up the incline.&nbsp;&nbsp; The three steps at
              the top however were a challenge.&nbsp; I told my son no big deal
              --- but he was skeptical.&nbsp; The locomotive was rolled to the
              rear of the table and then the front&nbsp; end of the track could be lifted
              together with the font wheels onto the step.&nbsp; The locomotive
              was then slid
              to the front and the back end was lifted up and on on the step.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Fortunately the step was wide enough to hold the 4
              wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              <p>Note that this scheme moved the weight of the locomotive over
              the set of wheels that were not lifted leaving only half the
              weight of the table over the wheels to be lifted.&nbsp;&nbsp; The track was
              essentially a lever to further reduce the weight to be
              lifted.&nbsp;</p>

              raised to match up to the 2X4 tracks and then slid into the
              vehicle and the table lowered to set on the rear cross 2X4.&nbsp;
              The locomotive was then easily rolled onto the wood track. &nbsp; This took a couple more minutes.&nbsp; My son said
              &quot;that was much easier than I expected&quot; .&nbsp; I told
              him &quot;it was well planned by an engineer&quot;.&nbsp; He wasn't impressed.</td>

              pegs proved to be too low.)&nbsp;&nbsp; This will keep the the locomotive from
              moving forward.&nbsp; Bungee cords were then used to secure the
              trucks to the 2X4s.&nbsp; One bungee was positioned so as to hold
              the locomotive against that 2X2 block.&nbsp; This should keep the

      <p align="left">The shay has arrived!&nbsp;&nbsp; All that is needed is to
      connect everything together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wal-Mart bag on the
      tender is an &quot;economy&quot; cover for a foam
      cushion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's Dick McCloy, MCC President
      observing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">The return ride went smoothly too.&nbsp; Loading took less
      than 5 minutes and the same to unload back home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">The tender securing arrangement consisting of the stud in
      the front and the bungee cord across the rear of the truck seems to be a
      good long term solution.</p>
      <p align="left">The locomotive securing arrangement also worked well and
      is satisfactory for a while.&nbsp; However, the wood block stop ahead of
      the left foot peg won't work after the foot pegs are raised.&nbsp; The
      bungee cords are also a pain to put on and take off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dick
      McCloy suggested a dummy coupler in the front.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
      possibility is to make something that clamps the two trucks
      down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will come back and update this when I get that all
      figured out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              and reinstall.&nbsp;&nbsp; A cross brace rests against the
              seatback hinges which will keep the unit from sliding forward if
              the back of the unit is prevented from lifting up.&nbsp; The photo
              shows a fixture that connects the wood unit to the spare tire
              hold-down bolt.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will hold the wood track unit
              down and against the seatback hinges.</td>

              pretty well but were a chore to connect.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fixture
              shown on the right was made to restrain the front of the
              locomotive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The vertical bar in the center was
              machined to accept the front coupler.&nbsp; (I've been told&nbsp;
              3/4&quot; angle will also work.)&nbsp; The bar across the top
              supports the bar and also prevents&nbsp; the coupler from sliding
              up in the case of a sudden stop.&nbsp; The locomotive is rolled
              against the bar with an open coupler.&nbsp; Once the coupler
              closes and&nbsp; latches, the locomotive is
