        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The first time I had the shay on the track with other 
        larger steamers and diesels I felt a bit inferior because they had more 
        power and ran faster.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was most pronounced if some of 
        the other locomotives were 2.5&quot; scale narrow gauge running on the 7.5&quot; 
        gauge track.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This spring and my son Andy and I 
        visited Jim Zealer's track in nearby Pataskala, Ohio.&nbsp; The main 
        purpose of the trip was to observe a large narrow gauge Mikado.&nbsp; I 
        took the shay along hoping to get a chance to try it out on the steep 
        grades Jim had told me would be an ideal test for a shay.&nbsp; Jim lent 
        me about eight cars.&nbsp; Andy, Dick McCloy and his dad Sid and I boarded and away we went.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Within 100 yards the shay was struggling and several times I had to stop 
        to build steam.&nbsp; One time I built the steam to 120 psi and opened the throttle 
        and the wheels actually slipped.&nbsp; It was like I was dragging an 
        anchor.&nbsp; And yes, the parking brake was off.&nbsp; The final test 
        was the steep slope on the final loop.&nbsp; I took it really 
        slow, maybe 5 scale mph (on the bicycle speedometer) but stalled when 
        the pressure dropped to 80 psi.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stopped, build a little 
        steam and finally made it over the hump and&nbsp; back to the yard 
        before that Mikado ran over us.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We took a break and tried to figure out what was wrong.&nbsp; 
        Dick suggested maybe the load was too great ---- maybe we all had been 
        consuming too many pizzas.&nbsp; The eight cars were pretty heavy, maybe 
        200 lbs each. The shay is maybe 500 lbs and the four people weigh about 
        800 lbs so that's 3000 lbs total.&nbsp; The grade seemed really steep, 
        maybe 6%.&nbsp; That means the force required to move the train up that 
        grade was about 180 lbs.&nbsp; Some time back I'd used an on-line 
        calculator to compute the shay tractive force as part of the design 
        process for the engine on the Heisler project.&nbsp; I recalled that 
        calculator indicated that the maximum tractive force for the shay at 100 
        psi was ~ 200 lbs, so maybe&nbsp; I should have expected it to stall --- 
        maybe I was trying to pull too much.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Later, I cut off half the cars and half the people and was able to climb 
        all the grades with no difficulty.&nbsp; I was also able to maintain 
        steam pressure if I went really slow.&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">There are two issues here: </font> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">What load can the shay pull --- this is a tractive force 
        issue.</font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">At what speed can the shay pull the load while 
        maintaining pressure --- this is a power issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Relating the steam pressure to the starting tractive force is a 
        simple high school physics problem  .&nbsp; I should be able to 
        measure this force using an inexpensive scale of sorts.&nbsp; The power 
        issue is&nbsp; more complex so I decided to deal with the force issue 
        first.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Tractive Force:</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="Shay.jpg" width="720" height="496"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The graph above shows how the starting tractive force 
        changes as a function of the crank position.&nbsp; There are three 
        double acting pistons and each piston has a peak torque point each half 
        crankshaft cycle and the peaks are evenly distributed around the crankshaft 
        rotation so the three peaks on the graph should be expected.&nbsp; The 
        sharp drops are less obvious. A valve closes to admission at 85% of 
        the stroke (85% cutoff) which corresponds to 135 degree crank rotation 
        from the start of the stoke.&nbsp; The valve opens 
        to exhaust a bit further on in the rotation.&nbsp; From a starting traction point of view, a piston with a 
        closed input or open exhaust valve generates no force.&nbsp; The sharp 
        drops correspond to the points where a valve closes to admission.&nbsp; 
        Note that the normalized values range from a minimum of 1.2 to a maximum 
        of 1.9.&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The complete equation for the shay starting tractive 
        force is:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Tractive Force (min) =&nbsp; 1.2 X (Boiler Pressure) X ( 
        Piston Area) X (Stroke) x (Gear Ratio) / (Wheel Diameter)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Tractive Force (max) =&nbsp; 1.9 X (Boiler Pressure) X ( 
        Piston Area) X (Stroke) x (Gear Ratio) / (Wheel Diameter)&nbsp; </font> </p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">the piston diameter is 1.375&quot; giving an area of 1.48 sq

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The wheel diameter is 4&quot;</font></p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">These values compute to 133 lbs min and 210 lbs max 
        starting tractive force.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The next step was to measure the force.&nbsp; The first 
        attempt was to push against a large bathroom scale.&nbsp; The readings 
        were in the ballpark but unstable because we were unable to hold the 
        scale perpendicular to the track. I had no confidence in the 
        data.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The next step was to purchase a linear hanging spring 
        scale with a 330 lb capacity from McMaster-Carr (#1756T5). One end of 
        the scale was connected to the coupler with a ~ 6 ft cloth strap and the 
        other end was wrapped around&nbsp; a track stop.&nbsp; The end at the 
        stop was held by an able assistant. The assistant could release a small 
        amount of strap and then hold that position so readings could be taken 
        at various crank positions. </font> </p>
        <p align="center">
        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="Measure1.jpg" width="650" height="513"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The photo above shows taking a measurement while 
        backing.&nbsp; That is Dick McCloy managing the strap. </font> </p>
        <p align="center">
        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="Measure2.jpg" width="699" height="525"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;Photo above shows one of the scale readings --- in 
        this case one of the highest readings while backing.&nbsp; The readings 
        ranged from 125 lbs to 185 lbs while backing and 125 lbs to 175 lbs 
        while going forward. Interestingly, the engine didn't slip while going 
        backward (with no engineer) but did slip at some crank positions when 
        heading forward.&nbsp; The slipping stopped when the engineer got on 
        board. (Maybe oil dripped on the track between the two tests.)&nbsp; 
        These measurements were taken at ~ 110 psi steam pressure.&nbsp; The 
        readings at 100 psi should be ~ 9% less or&nbsp; 115 lbs to 170 psi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Recall that the computed range was 133 to 210 lbs. </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">At first glance, the measurements are well below those 
        computed and were disappointing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thought was that 
        the pressure on the pistons was less because of valve and packing leaks.&nbsp; 
        However, there weren't noticeably large leaks and since the pistons were 
        not moving and the throttle was wide open, the pressure might be the 
        most stable part of the setup.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next, I closed the throttle and measured the force to 
        get the locomotive moving --- about 25 lbs --- this is friction.&nbsp; 
        The measured 115 lbs to 170 psi was after the friction loss.&nbsp; If 
        the 25 lbs friction loss is added back in, the force generated by the 
        engine is 140 lbs to 195 lbs, very close to that calculated..&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">(Later in the day Dick and Dan Staron measured the the 
        tractive force on Dan's shay and got slightly lower readings but Dan was 
        at 100 psi so they were probably consistent the measurements on my shay.)
        </font> </p>
        <p align="center">
        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="Measure3.jpg" width="694" height="509"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next, we used the scale to measure the tractive force of 
        a couple of Dick's diesels.&nbsp; The photo above shows Dick on his SW1500.&nbsp; 
        This locomotive generated ~225 lbs force and then started slipping.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        We also tested his FA and found it slipped at about 250 lbs.&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The tractive force determines how much of a load the 
        locomotive can get moving.&nbsp; The measurements tell us that the 
        diesels can get about twice the load moving as the shay.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next question is --- how much load can the Shay move 
        around&nbsp; Dick's Mill Creek Central Track?&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        track has a maximum&nbsp; grade of&nbsp; ~3.5%.&nbsp; I can probably 
        maintain 100 psi at the short distance that is the maximum grade so how 
        many cars can I pull?&nbsp; I used the scale to pull a dozen hopper cars 
        in the level yard and found it took less than 10 lbs.&nbsp; So, it's 
        probably sufficient to deduct the 25 lbs for the locomotive friction 
         
        and forget the car friction.&nbsp; The question then is what weight 
        train will require generate a 115 lb tractive load on a 3.5 % grade?&nbsp;&nbsp; If we 
        divide 115 lbs by 0.035, we find the max train weight is 3285 lbs.&nbsp; 
        the locomotive and engineer together weigh ~ 700 lbs so the rest of the 
        train can weigh 2600 lbs.&nbsp; If the cars weigh 200 lbs each, then a 
        maximum of 13 cars can be pulled around the track. </font> </p>
        <p align="center">
        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="Run1.JPG" width="700" height="290"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The above photo shows the shay pulling 15 cars and we 
        made it all around the track with no problem as far as the tractive 
        effort (the speed is another issue).&nbsp; So, is my calculation wrong? 
        Yes, the cars probably weigh less&nbsp;than 200 lbs each and the 
        engineer shown in the photo is pretty skinny so the locomotive plus 
        engineer probably weighs less than the 700 lbs estimate. &nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Power:</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The previous measurements show that the shay produces 
        about half the usable tractive force as Dick's diesels.&nbsp; 
        However, the shay probably produces about one tenth the power. For 
        example, I could maintain pressure at a speed of about 6 scale mph on 
        the lesser slope parts of the track with the 15 car load pictured above.&nbsp; 
        Dick's diesels would have no trouble pulling the same load at 60 scale 
        mph or faster.&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The capability to produce steam is the limiting factor 
        with the shay.&nbsp; The ability to produce steam is limited by the 
        firebox size.&nbsp; (Ken Schroeder pointed out that there was room to 
        extend the firebox a few inches on the three truck configuration.&nbsp; 
        I should have followed up on that observation before ordering the 
        boiler.)&nbsp; There is a clear speed-load trade off. If you run too 
        fast with a given load, the pressure will drop and you have to slow down 
        or stop to build pressure before tackling a long grade. </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">There is very little energy storage in the small shay 
        boiler so one must limit the speed to match the steam generation capability. 
        However, one can get the most use of the the small storage but managing the water level.&nbsp; 
        One can add water on the downgrades and flats and get to maximum 
        pressure at maximum water before tackling the more difficult grades and then 
        stop adding water on the grade.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">A nagging question ---- how many HP is the Shay ---- or 
        more accurately --- how may HP can the boiler/firebox produce.&nbsp; The 
        ideal way to measure this is to have a setup where the shay is pulling a 
        constant load and the throttle is adjusted so that pressure is 
        maintained while just enough water is added to replace that consumed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        That sounds like a difficult setup.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">However, as a rough guess, I think I can pull about half 
        the minimum starting tractive force at about 10 scale mph.  I have a bicycle 
        speedometer setup for scale mph.&nbsp; I 
        set this speedometer up for 1.6&quot; scale so the 10 mph is 1.33 actual mph 
        which is 7022 ft/hr or 1.95 ft/sec.&nbsp; If I can generate&nbsp;70 lbs 
        tractive force at this 
        speed and maintain pressure, the power is 137 ft-lb/sec.&nbsp; Recall 
        that one HP is 550 ft-lb/sec, so the 137 ft-lb/sec is about 0.25 HP. How 
        accurate is this?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; But I'm sure that it 
        not off by more than a factor of 4 so the&nbsp; power is definitely 
        between 0.1 and 1 HP.&nbsp; Next time at the track I'll have to try to 
        get a better handle on this. </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Another way to try to get a handle on the power is to 
        measure the fuel usage and convert that to BTU and then try to guess at 
        the system efficiency.&nbsp; Maybe I can work that out to within a 
        factor of 2. </font> </p>

            <font face="Arial">This past summer I got an email from John 
            Pickering in the UK.&nbsp; John has been doing some research in 
            anticipation of building a Shay.&nbsp; Part of his input is as 
            follows:&nbsp; </font></p>
            <font id="role_document" face="Arial" color="#000000">
            <div>
              &nbsp;<i>I have some comments on the web page on power&nbsp;and tractive 
              force. If you go to <a href="http://modeleng.org/software.htm">
              http://modeleng.org/software.htm</a> you can download a 
              spreadsheet called &quot;engine&quot; which predicts locomotive performance. 
              I have not yet bought Kenneth Schroeder's drawings but suspect 
              that his boiler is similar to The Hiraoka design, albeit with more 
              fire tubes. If&nbsp;I enter&nbsp;the parameters I know for&nbsp;Kenneth 
              Schroeder's design with&nbsp;the Hiraoka boiler, but with 25 half inch 
              tubes, it predicts a tractive effort of 180.8 lbs at 85% of normal 
              boiler pressure. More important it&nbsp;estimates the boiler 
              performance.&nbsp;The spreadsheet is intended for coal fired loco's, if 
              we assume&nbsp;it is fired with 1&quot; coals and has a&nbsp;2&quot; fire bed it 
              predicts 17.69 KW. to the steam at a boiler&nbsp;efficiency of 66.35%. 
              This corresponds to a thermal input of 26.66 KW. At the IMLEC. 
              model efficiency trials the best models achieve over 1% thermal 
              efficiency but most are a little under this value. If we assume 
              your Shay achieves around 1%, the sustained mechanical 
              output&nbsp;would be 267 W. or 0.358 BHP. Quite close to your measured 
              values. As you say it is the ability of the boiler to produce 
              steam which is the limiting factor. If my 60 ton class C ever sees 
              the light of day may be it will get the longer firebox!</i></div>

            fire box described at <a href="../MorePower/MorePower.htm">More 
            Power</a> so the thought of measuring the total output power is on 
            my mind again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's winter now and too cold for 
            tests --- but I have some time to plan for tests in the spring.&nbsp; 
            I plan to review some of the articles on the model engineering 
            website Jon Pickering mentioned above (
            <a href="http://modeleng.org/articles.htm">
            http://modeleng.org/articles.htm</a>) .&nbsp; Another reference point is the amount of heat generated by the 
            oil fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heat content of the diesel fuel is 
            146,000 BTU/Gal.&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3413 BTU per KWH this converts to 
            42.7 KWH/gal fuel.&nbsp; At 1% efficiency this corresponds to 427 WH/gal 
            of fuel consumed.&nbsp;&nbsp; My guess is that I'm consuming about a 
            gallon or slightly more fuel per hour at full burner setting.&nbsp; 
            (That's something to measure next year.)&nbsp; If the consumption is 
            exactly 1 gal/hr and the efficiency is exactly 1%, then the power 
            output is 427/745 = 0.57 HP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">After taking all the measurements Dan Staron and I 
        hooked our shays together and hauled a string of 27 cars (if I counted correctly) 
        around the track.&nbsp; The total track length is about a mile and with 
        this load each trip took about 45 minutes.&nbsp; One might ask, what is 
        the probability of two steam locomotives running for 45 minutes without 
        a problem? We did get a couple loops without a breakdown.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; 
        I had a problem all day getting enough water to the boiler.&nbsp; After 
        checking the pump and scratching my head, Dick McCloy suggested the 
        strainer screen might be partially plugged.&nbsp; Good idea!&nbsp; 
        Later, a screw came out of the bracket securing Dan's axel pump.&nbsp; 
        Then my tubes became so sooted that I couldn't make it back without 
        cleaning them. (I had not cleaned the tubes this year in a test to see 
        how long I could go.&nbsp; The new fire pan has worked out great.&nbsp; 
        If I clean the tubes once each day and adjust the blower and fuel levels 
        so there is no smoke, it works great!) </font> </p>
