      <p align="left">The first run was on April 28th, 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      It was a very sunny warm day.&nbsp;&nbsp; My son&nbsp;accompanied me ----
      I suspect he didn't want to miss the explosion.&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrived at
      the track about noon.&nbsp;</p>

              other end.&nbsp; It only took a couple minutes to fill the boiler
              via the open blowdown valve.&nbsp; About 1 oz of LSB 8000 was
              poured in the clear plastic hose before the garden hose was
              connected.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the LSB 8000 bottle on the fuel

              <p>We then started up the long ~ 3% grade.&nbsp; It made it ---
              but very slowly. The engine has plenty of power, the problem was
              producing enough steam.</p>

              opened and the fire finally started --- at least the accumulated
              fuel in the fire pan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flames came out
              of&nbsp; the open door and overheated the pressure gauge as seen in the

              sensitive the gauge is to ambient temperature --- I could have

              replace the melted plastic one.&nbsp;&nbsp; The gauge was tested later&nbsp; to make sure that it still worked, but it only
              hissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a $32 US Gauge sold for use with
              steam models.&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp; $10 replacement was ordered from
              McMaster -Carr.&nbsp; After the new gauge arrived the damaged
              gauge was opened.&nbsp; The trouble was that the solder joints at
              each end of the bourdon tube were leaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              joints were repaired with higher temperature solder.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The face should have been covered with a wet towel to prevent
              the scorched paint on the lower left side of the dial.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              It now works and is accurate so the only damage was the plastic lens and the scorch
              marks.
              <p>During the process of looking for a new gauge I found that MSC
              sells US Gauges that look just like this one for&nbsp; less than
              $5.&nbsp;&nbsp; A future project is to get a couple of those, take
              them apart and compare them&nbsp; to this $32 gauge and the $10
              gauges from
              McMaster-Carr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The foot boards on the front are too
          low and dragged several&nbsp; times.&nbsp; They need to be
          raised about a half inch.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The tender water hoses hang down a little too far ----
          should be shortened about an inch.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The foot pegs are too low --- I had them about an
          inch above the rail.&nbsp; That was a temporary arrangement&nbsp;
          ----- some operational data was needed before making them permanent.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The tender brakes were dragging slightly --- minor
          adjustment required.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The steam brakes were very slow to respond ---- the
          cylinders have too far to travel. That will require more study.&nbsp;
          If the throttle is open, the reversing lever brakes it very
          quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;The steam powered water pump worked very slow -----&nbsp;
          much slower than the week before --- maybe a lubrication scheme is required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left"><b>Summary: </b>The good news is that the locomotive
      seemed to run very well.&nbsp;&nbsp; We did one test where we were pulling
      a couple cars uphill with Dan and Andy riding.&nbsp; Dan was able to stop
      the locomotive with his feet ---- but he said it wasn't easy.&nbsp; The
      wheels will stop without spinning.&nbsp; The operation seemed to
      deteriorate with use.&nbsp; That is more evident now than it was at the
      time.&nbsp; The problem was with the steaming --- it became more difficult
      to maintain pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also see from several of the photos
      above that it was smoking indicating that the burner was too
      rich.&nbsp;&nbsp; After I got it home I found that several of the blower
      holes were plugged which explains why the burner couldn't be
      lit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, there was quite a bit of soot in the
      tubes.&nbsp; The next step is to enlarge those blower holes so that they
      don't plug so easily.&nbsp; Then a a bit of effort to optimize the
      steaming capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Special thanks to Dick McCloy and the gang at Mill Creek
      Central for their help and support.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks also to Dan Sharon
      who has been a great resource as we a both building a shay.&nbsp; Dan took
      many of the photos on this page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
