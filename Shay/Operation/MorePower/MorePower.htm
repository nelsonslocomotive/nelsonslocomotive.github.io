      <p><font face="Arial">A couple really busy years have passed since the last 
      major improvements to the Shay&nbsp; ---- volunteer teaching trips&nbsp; plus design  
      of a new house have limited the activity with the Shay.&nbsp;&nbsp; We 
      moved into the new house at the end of August and the shop was operation 
      in operation a couple weeks after.&nbsp; (An update of the shop description is a good 
      project for the cold winter.) </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Meanwhile --- the construction at Mill Creek Central Railroad has 
      proceeded at a brisk pace with the completion of the Mountain Division 
      reverse loop in late spring 2008.&nbsp; See the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.millcreekcentral.com/Track/Track.htm">Track and Structures

      The elevation graph below shows the killer grades at MCC. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">This fall I fired up the Shay and 
      tried it up the big hill ---- from Barney Yard up Wilson Siding, through Varian Tunnel, across Tower meadow, over 
      the trestle and up the final grade to the peak just beyond the gas well.&nbsp; How did it go? 
      Embarrassing!&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shay had to go very slow ----- like 5 scale 
      mph.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't add water on the grade or would loose pressure 
      and would have to stop to rebuild it.&nbsp; Had to stop at Tower siding to 
      add water to the boiler and rebuild pressure. </font> </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Shay has been able to make the grade from Daffodil 
      siding to Barney yard with no problem.&nbsp; I usually stop at the yard to add water to 
      the tender so it was no problem if I got there with low water in the 
      boiler and low steam pressure.&nbsp; The big difference is that the grade to 
      the gas well is much longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Elevations.jpg" width="700" height="584"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Note that between Daffodil siding and Barney yard the track climbs about 
      15 feet in a distance of about 1300 feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrast, the 
      climb from Barney yard to the high point just beyond the gas well is about 35 feet in a 
      distance of about 2700 feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's clear that the performance 
      on the long grades is limited by the ability to generate steam.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      This is not a problem on a&nbsp; railroad with limited grades 
      --- the Shay can easily pull ten or more cars on flat or nearly flat 
      tracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The simple solution is to just open the oil valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Unfortunately,&nbsp; increasing the oil causes the fire to smoke and 
      quickly soot the tubes --- little extra heat is generated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Increasing the blower pressure helps some 
      but the steam through the blower is lost --- it would better used to drive 
      the pistons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exhaust seems to have little effect on 
      the draft --- not what one would expect.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The biggest problem seems to be insufficient draft.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The first step was to take a look at the smoke box to see if there was 
      a way to improve the draft. </font> </p>

            removed several years ago. </font> </td>

            On the original design, the petticoat slides over the part of the smokestack that sticks 
            down into the smoke box.&nbsp;&nbsp; A piece of thick tubing was 
            inserted between the smoke stack and the petticoat.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
            tubing was turned so that the bottom slides into the petticoat and 
            the top slides over the smokestack.&nbsp; Large holes were then 
            drilled near the top of the tube and through the part of the smoke 
            stack that was inside the tube (the smokestack was removed for this 
            machining). .&nbsp; These holes were then enlarged on the 
            mill.&nbsp; The holes are a little over 5/8&quot; high and more than 3/4&quot; 
            across.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the bottom of the petticoat is about 
            1.5&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; lower than before. </font> </td>

      <p><font face="Arial">The effect of the changes to the petticoat was very significant.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Previously, the blower pressure had to be set to 30 psi or greater to 
      prevent significant smoking at the lowest fuel setting that would provide 
      a stable fire. &nbsp; After the change the burner would operate at 
      below 15 psi blower and there seems to be a&nbsp; greater range of useful oil feed 
      and blower settings.&nbsp; At the track I found the performance on the big 
      hill was much better ---- it was no longer an embarrassment.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      With these changes to the petticoat the exhaust provided some draft and 
      the blower 
      could be set to about 10 psi with open throttle.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Dick McCloy suggested that we run a test with the atomizer and blower 
      supplied from a portable air tank --- the Shay plumbing is such that air 
      can be supplied to the atomizer and blower for startup.&nbsp; We charged a 
      ~10 gallon portable tank to ~ 100 psi and started up the hill through 
      Wilson siding with the 
      blower pressure set at 15 psi.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The tank was essentially empty before we got to the tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The message is clear ---&nbsp; the blower really sucks the steam --- we 
      should try to generate more draft from the exhaust. </font> </p>

      the 6 cars shown above with a husky engineer and brakeman up the grade to 
      the gas well 
      without stopping.&nbsp;&nbsp; The speed was 5 to 10 scale mph on the 
      steepest grades and 15 scale mph or greater on the milder grades.&nbsp; I 
      was able to add water as we went along and had a full boiler when we got 
      to the top.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing was different ---&nbsp; the axel pump couldn't 
      quite keep up with the consumption ---- maybe I'm able to burn more fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used the steam powered pump to 
      add some water when we went through Tower siding.&nbsp;&nbsp; The smaller 
      exhaust nozzle greatly increased the draft ---- I could both turn off the 
      blower when the throttle was open&nbsp; and also increase the amount of 
      oil slightly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The smaller nozzle also produces a more pleasing exhaust 
      sound.&nbsp; There was one problem ---- the fire blew off more often.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      On the other hand, it seemed to be easier to relight with the igniter.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Just after this photo was taken, the&nbsp; operation became more 
      erratic--- the fire seemed to be too lean and completely opening the valve 
      had little effect.&nbsp; The fuel filter was blow out at the beginning of 
      the day but it seemed to be partially plugged again. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">It was decided to take the shay back home to exercise it on the test 
      stand to try to make the burner less prone to blowing out.&nbsp; (It may 
      be that the filter was partially plugged and the fire was too lean.)&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Dick McCloy had another suggestion --- attach the output pipe from the 
      axel pump to the under side of the fire pan to make a feed water heater.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <tr>
            <td width="50%"><font face="Arial">The first thing I did after the 
            shay was back in the shop was to disconnect the fuel line at the 
            atomizer, open the fuel valve and drain the near full tank of oil.&nbsp; 
            The flow was very limited.&nbsp; After an hour the flow slowed to a 
            drip and 3/4 of the fuel was still in the tank.&nbsp; A shot of air 
            back though the fuel line and filter got things going again.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Had to do that once more to get the tank empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            The photo at right shows the problem --- a sludge at the bottom of 
            the fuel tank which plugged the filter.&nbsp; This happened once before several years ago.&nbsp; 
            It is my understanding that the sludge is caused by the growth of microbes in the 
            water at the bottom of the tank. </font>

        </table>
      <p><font face="Arial">So --- I leaned that when the 
            fuel filter plugs up, microbes are probably growing in the fuel tank.&nbsp; 
            The fuel should be drained and the tank cleaned.&nbsp; It's probably 
            a good idea to drain the tank each fall and clean it.&nbsp; That 
            should fix the problem since it seems to take several years to get 
            the growth started. ( I also learned that the odor from the diesel 
            fuel I'm using can linger in the house for many hours and some women 
            find that odor unpleasant.) </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">After cleaning everything and putting fresh fuel in 
      the tank I fired it up on the test stand (bearings under the wheels).&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">All the problems with the fire going out seemed to 
      have gone away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire would burn with essentially no smoke at 10 
      psi blower setting and a low fuel setting.&nbsp; The fuel valve could be 
      fully opened and there was very little smoke with the blower at about 30 
      psi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The burner seems to be about 2:1 range from low to 
      high.&nbsp;&nbsp; The limiting factor for the amount of fuel seemed to be 
      the fuel nozzle itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is good news ---- I seem to be using 
      the full capability of the nozzle.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also tells me that the 
      under construction Heisler which is a bit larger than the Shay should have 
      two oil nozzles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The exhaust was able to provide sufficient draft and 
      the blower could be shut off completely when the throttle was partially 
      open.&nbsp;&nbsp; Opening and closing the throttle did not cause the fire 
      to go out except at the lowest fuel settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The oil feed line was under the fire pan.&nbsp; I 
      tried pushing it up against the bottom of the fire pan.&nbsp; The 
      operation seemed to get erratic --- so I concluded that running the line 
      below the fire pan with a little gap provided about all the oil 
      heating that can be tolerated and still have reliable operation. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">During this test the holes in the sides of the 
      firebox were covered.&nbsp; I uncovered one of the holes to see if the 
      operation was different.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was not a 
      significant difference good or bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, with low 
      draft settings the fire would shoot out the side through those holes.&nbsp; 
      That is not so good so it was decided to keep those holes covered. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">While writing this up I realized that it sounded 
      almost too good to be true ---- especially the fact that I could 
      completely open the fuel valve and not get much smoke.&nbsp; I decided to 
      test it again to make sure before making any other modifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      I blew out the fuel filter to make sure it was really clean. I also topped 
      off the fuel take so I'd have maximum fuel pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">It was a cold day&nbsp; --- 26 F at 10 AM when photo above 
      was snapped.&nbsp; This is just outside the shop door.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      (Earlier in the day a bunch of ducks were swimming in the lake.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Don't understand why they didn't fly south for the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I should 
      take pity on them and invite them in for dinner --- they are great with a 
      cherry sauce.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">With the full oil tank I was able to make the fire too 
      rich.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, even when too rich it didn't seem to smoke as 
      much as before the modifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the very cold weather it was 
      difficult to tell whether the exhaust was all steam or whether there was 
      some smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, I can't think of anything else to do 
      to&nbsp; 
      generate more heat from the burner.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I ran the axel pump a little during this test and was 
      reminded of the cooling effect of adding water so that probably the best 
      next improvement to work on. </font> </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">When&nbsp; I took everything apart to 
      make the feed water modifications I also cleaned the tubes.&nbsp; There 
      was considerable soot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspect that the soot accumulated on 
      the previous outing when I was having trouble with the plugged filter and 
      the burner going out a lot.&nbsp; I also recall that I forget to&nbsp; add 
      the&nbsp; RED DEVIL SOOT REMOVER the last time I filled the fuel can.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      This is probably a good reminder to not get too cavalier with the oil 
      mixture.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Photo above shows the fire pan after 
      the water feed lines have been routed through it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      copper tube down the outside is the oil feed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      smaller stainless tube only visible on the left is the atomizer steam feed 
      --- it is unchanged from the previous photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      stainless tube across the top of the photo is for the feed water from the 
      steam powered pump ---- this tube was previously unsuccessfully used for 
      heating the oil feed.&nbsp; The U shaped tub is for the feed water from the 
      axel pump.&nbsp;&nbsp;The atomizer steam tube is 3/16&quot; 
      OD and all the other tubes are 1/4&quot; OD.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the tubes are 
      connected with compression fittings to facilitate removal for maintenance.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The modifications were tested on the 
      test stand before making the trip to the track.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was 
      about 35 degrees F during the test.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used an infrared 
      thermometer to measure the following temperatures while the boiler 
      pressure was about 110 psi.</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Boiler above crown sheet - 305 degrees 
      F</font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Smokestack base - 305 degrees F</font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Axel pump feed water&nbsp; when engine 
      was running at ~ 10 scale mph - 190 degrees F</font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Steam pump feed water -- moderate pump 
      speed ~ 130 degrees F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The boiler and smokestack base 
      temperatures are a little low for 110 psi pressure ---- ~340 degrees would 
      be expected and indeed temperatures near 340 degrees have been measured on 
      warm summer days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guess the cold temperatures had some impact 
      on the measurements.&nbsp; Previously, the top of the smoke box was quite 
      a bit warmer than the boiler ---- the holes in the smoke stack at the top 
      of the smoke box probably allow those hot gases to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't know 
      whether that is good or bad.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;The feed water heaters did work 
      --especially the axel pump heater.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tender had been filled 
      in the shop so the water temperature was probably about 60 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The temperature of the output of the feed water heater was measured by 
      shining the infrared thermometer on the water tube about 6&quot; from the fire 
      pan.&nbsp; Based on the measurements, the cooling effect of the feed 
      water from the axel pump is reduced by at least 50%.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next 
      step is a field test on the big hill at Mill Creek Central.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font></p>
        <hr>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Went back to Mill Creek Central for a 
      final test run on the Sunday before thanksgiving.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a few 
      degrees above freezing when I did the run.&nbsp; I had one car attached 
      with two passengers.&nbsp; The performance was very good in that we made 
      it to the peak just beyond the gas well with essentially full pressure and 
      a boiler full of water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We made good speed on the way up 
      --- ~10 scale mph on the steepest grades and about twice that on the less 
      challenging grades.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I seemed to be able to burn more fuel 
      without significant smoking.&nbsp; Dick McCloy commented that these was 
      much less of a trailing oil smoke stench.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The burner 
      operation seemed very stable.&nbsp; It only blew out a couple times, each 
      time apparently due to a too lean of mixture ----- as the oil level in the 
      tank goes down, the valve has to be opened more. The total run time was 
      about an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran with some blower -- 
      about 10 psi even when the throttle was open some.&nbsp; &nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The feed water heaters did work and 
      contributed to the performance. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">After the run I cleaned a few of the 
      tubes and found a little soot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This probably happened 
      when I ran very rich for a while to see if it improved performance --- it 
      didn't.&nbsp; At the rate it accumulated I would probably not have to 
      clean the tubes more than once every 8 hours of operation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      next challenge will be to&nbsp; understand the burner well enough to be 
      able to set the oil to the maximum possible with no soot accumulating.&nbsp;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Further tests must await warm weather --- probably next 
      April. &nbsp; </font></p>

        <ol>
          <li>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The biggest improvement&nbsp; came from 
      the changes to the petticoat and the part of the smoke stack that hangs 
      down into the smoke box. .&nbsp; These changes doubled the efficiency of 
      the blower.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The next biggest improvement came from 
      reducing the exhaust nozzle diameter which together with the changes 
      listed in 1 creates sufficient draft so that the blower can be shut off 
      when the throttle is open.&nbsp; Over half the improvement came from 
      changes 1 &amp; 2. <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The larger fire pan together with changes listed above 
      seem to allow more fuel to be burned.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have a measure 
      on this but suspect the improvement is in the 10% to 20% range.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Significant heating of the oil caused the burner to not 
      operate properly --- the fire was erratic.&nbsp; Heating the oil doesn't 
      work!<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Heating the atomizer steam seemed to improve the burner 
      operation ---- this is probably a less than 5% effect. <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The feed water heaters are a significant improvement, 
      especially the heater for the axel pump feed water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      These changes probably account for on the order of 25% of the improvement.

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p align="left">
