      <p>The shay is near the end of the third summer and it seems to run pretty 
      well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The major limitation is the power output 
      of the boiler system.&nbsp; There is no problem on a relatively flat 
      track.&nbsp; However on 3% or greater grades with a large load the speed 
      is limited to about 12 scale mph. ( Note that with the prototype, 12 mph 
      was about top speed and on a 3% grade it'd be going half that or less.)&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The shay runs at <a href="http://www.millcreekcentral.com">Mill Creek 
      Central</a> which has lots of hills.&nbsp; There are usually some 
      large steamers as well as diesels running so it's simple courtesy to run 
      fast enough to not hold up the others.&nbsp; The boiler output is limited 
      by the boiler design.&nbsp; The challenge is to get the maximum steam from 
      the design.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Simply put, the goal is to produce the maximum energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
      goal can be accomplished by burning fuel at the maximum possible rate 
      and at the same time extracting the maximum heat from fire.&nbsp; After 
      fooling with several burner evolutions it was useful to list what&nbsp;was learned (this is probably obvious to an experience fireman):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Fuel - Oxygen Mixture: </b>&nbsp; If the mixture is too lean 
          (too much oxygen, too little fuel) the fire will likely go out.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          If the mixture is too rich (too little oxygen, too much fuel) the fire 
          gives off a heavy black smoke and quickly fills the flues with soot.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <b>&nbsp;</b>If the proper ratio of fuel and oxygen is present, then 
          the fuel will be completely consumed and little or no smoke will be 
          given off and there will be little or no build up of soot in the tubes.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li><b>Draft:&nbsp; </b>Draft refers to the current of gases that 
          flows into the firebox and then out of the firebox through the flues and up the stack.&nbsp; If there is 
          insufficient draft, insufficient oxygen will be draw into the firebox 
          and the fire will burn rich (black smoke&nbsp; &amp; soot in tubes).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          If the draft is too great, the fire may go out.&nbsp; Another&nbsp; 
          undesirable effect of too great draft is that the gases leave the 
          firebox and flues at too great a rate and too much heat goes up the 
          stack. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li><b>Forced Draft:&nbsp; </b>The draft is forced by the engine 
          exhaust and the blower.&nbsp; The blower has the most effect.&nbsp; The 
          exhaust nozzle is quite large for the exhaust volume.&nbsp; This is 
          good in that there is little back pressure thus improving engine 
          efficiency.&nbsp; Because the draft is primarily controlled by the 
          blower, the proper mixture is not effected much by changes in throttle 
          setting. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li><b>Blower Holes:&nbsp; </b>Ken Schroeder specified 1/32&quot;&nbsp; 
          blower nozzle holes in the blower ring.&nbsp; In the earlier 
          operation there was a problem with these holes plugging so they were enlarged  
          to ~0.050&quot;.&nbsp; This increased the amount of steam required for 
          the blower function and reduced efficiency.&nbsp; The holes were 
          plugged then drilled 1/32&quot; to match the drawings..&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
          improved the blower function.&nbsp; There seems to be no problem with 
          the holes plugging if an overly rich fire is avoided. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li><b>Closing the Fire Pan:</b>&nbsp; To avoid excess draft and the 
          associated heat loss up the stack we want to limit the air 
          entering the fire box to the minimum required for proper combustion.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          This can be achieved by closing all holes in the fire pan except the 
          entry point of air to be mixed with the fuel. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li><b>Mixing Air &amp; Fuel:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Air that supplies the oxygen 
          for combustion must be mixed with the fuel.&nbsp; This is true for 
          both oil and gas fired burners.&nbsp; The better this mixing action, 
          the better the burner efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        </ul>

        <p align="left"><b>Burner Operation: </b>The first tests of the burner 
        were made on the test stand.&nbsp;&nbsp; After fooling with it a while 
        the best operation seemed to be with: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        <p align="left">Blower set at ~30 psi<br>
&nbsp;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left">Atomizer regulator set at ~ 5 psi<br>
&nbsp;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left">Fuel set at point where a little white smoke is seen. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left">The fire is not very sensitive to the atomizer setting 
        but is very sensitive to the fuel and blower settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
        example, a slight increase in fuel setting or slight decrease in blower 
        such as back to 25 psi will cause the fire to smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the 
        fuel is increased very much beyond this setting the fire will smoke even 
        if the blower is increased to over 60 psi indicating that these settings 
        are near or at the maximum possible heating capability of the firebox 
        volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left">After the boiler had been up to ~110 psi pressure for about 
        20 minutes the following temperature measurements were taken using an 
        infrared thermometer: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        <p align="left">The temperature at the top back of the boiler was 345 F.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left">The temperature on the side of the smoke box was 310 F.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left">The temperature at the base of the smokestack was 345 F.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left">By contrast, the first fire pan design had large 
        openings around the nozzle which admitted much more air into the 
        firebox.&nbsp; With that design and similar fuel settings the temperature at the smoke box base 
        measured between 450 F and 500 F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This burner seems to be much more efficient.</p>
        <p align="left">The first test at the track went very well.&nbsp; The 
        fire went out once when the throttle 
        was opened the first time and a slug of water blew out the exhaust pipe.&nbsp; It was a very 
        cold day (high 40s) and there was time for only about one hour of operation.&nbsp; 
        The burner seemed to operate well.&nbsp;&nbsp; A week later the shay 
        was operated a couple more hours and it continued to perform well.&nbsp; A 
        first time operator ran it for about an hour with no problem.&nbsp; The 
        fire did go out for him a couple times.&nbsp; Both times the fuel valve 
        had to be opened a little further to get the correct fuel input.&nbsp; The fuel 
        adjustment was probably required because the fuel level in the tank was 
        lower thus reducing the rate of fuel flow.&nbsp; The igniter relit the 
        fire with no problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left">The current plan is to use this design in the 
        Heisler.&nbsp; The mixing chamber might be made slightly larger by using 
        a 1.25&quot;&nbsp; OD and 1&quot; ID.&nbsp;
        <font face="Times New Roman">The same type nozzle will probably be used.&nbsp; 
        It would be nice to find a better quality fuel valve.&nbsp; </font> </p>
