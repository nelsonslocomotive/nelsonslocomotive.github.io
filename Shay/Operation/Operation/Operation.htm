      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">On the first run there was a
      problem with the blower --- the blower holes plugged.&nbsp; The holes were
      enlarged to minimize future plugging.&nbsp; The operation was
      significantly different with these larger blower holes; the burner heat range
      increased significantly and the maximum possible heat appeared to be at least
      double that previously.&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of tests on the test stand were run over several days to
      determine and document the optimum settings.&nbsp; Also, the check list at
      the end of the page was developed to remind myself what should be done
      before, during,&nbsp; and after each run.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      
      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Burner Operation:&nbsp; </b>I
      understand that the heat output of the coal fired locomotive is controlled
      by the draft.&nbsp; After once started, the fire of a sitting locomotive
      can be turned down by merely reducing or turning off the blower.&nbsp;
      After sitting for an extended period, the&nbsp; fire will heat up quickly
      if the blower is increased.&nbsp; No one in the area has an operating
      propane burner so I can't comment on it.&nbsp; The oil burner seems at
      first&nbsp; glance to be a little more complicated than the coal
      burner.&nbsp; Ho</font>wever,&nbsp; <font size="3" face="Arial">after one
      becomes familiar with the operation and builds confidence, it works great
      ---&nbsp; without ashes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      
      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">I spent a number of hours over
      several days lighting and relighting the burner and running it up to full
      pressure to determine optimum settings for the following situations:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

            <td><b>Burner Lighter:&nbsp; </b>I was never able to light the cold
              burner with the igniter.&nbsp; Also, the igniter frequently won't
              light the burner if it's been off for more than a few minutes.&nbsp;
              Previously I had used a propane torch when the igniter wouldn't
              light it.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the propane torch won't fit in the
              engineer's pocket and I really didn't want to build a bracket to
              haul it with me.&nbsp; (Of course I could pull another car to
              carry the torch --- could even carry a large propane tank
              too.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The little butane units in the photo&nbsp; meet
              the needs and fit in a shirt pocket.&nbsp; The torch unit on the
              right is from the local hardware store and shoots a flame about
              two inches.&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit on the left is from Lowe's and is
              sold as a wind resistant fire source.&nbsp;&nbsp; The combination
              work well even on breezy days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>I've had limited success lighting the burner through the firebox
              door with this little torch.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it always works
              if pointed through the hole at the front end of the fire
              pan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <p><b>Lighting the Cold Burner:&nbsp; </b>Compressed air is required to
      get the burner started; 20 psi is adequate.&nbsp; (One could probably used
      an electric blower on the top of the stack to generate draft and only use the air
      for the atomizer.&nbsp; In that case,&nbsp; a tank of air or the spare
      tire might provide an adequate supply.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>I shut the valve between the blower/atomizer manifold and the steam
      turret so I can watch the steam pressure build on the&nbsp; gauge.&nbsp; I
      then set the blower and atomizer both for 8 psi ------- these are not that
      <font size="3" face="Arial">critical but I like to run the atomizer
      regulator at 8 psi so might as well start that way.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then
      light the little torch and&nbsp; point it in the front of the fire pan and slowly
      open the fuel valve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The burner lights at about 1/4
      turn.&nbsp; I then turn off the torch and put it in my pocket.&nbsp; There
      is considerable white smoke initially and then it becomes cleaner after
      a few seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blower and fuel valve can then be adjusted
      for a stable flame with no smoke.&nbsp;</font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Setting the Mixture:</b> The&nbsp; key
      points about the mixture are:</font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>A too lean mixture will cause the
      fire to flutter and possibly go out.</i></b></font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>A too rich mixture will cause the
      fire to smoke and possibly go out.</i></b></font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The mixture can be controlled by both the
      fuel valve and the blower valve:</font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>Opening the fuel valve makes the
      mixture richer; closing it makes it leaner.</i></b></font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>Opening the blower valve makes the
      mixture leaner; closing it makes it richer.</i></b></font></p>
      
      <p><b><i>A too rich mixture that is smoking will cause soot buildup in the
      tubes (bad ).</i></b></p>
      
      <p><b><i>The optimum setting is just leaner of the point where smoke is noticeable.&nbsp;</i></b></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">For my particular setup, a relatively low
      setting is with the blower at 10 psi and the fuel valve open about a
      quarter turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A high setting is with the blower at 30 to
      40 psi and the fuel valve opened one half turn or so with a full fuel
      tank. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      
      <p><b>Switching the atomizer from air to steam:&nbsp;</b> Once the steam
      pressure is at 20 to 30 psi, the air line can be disconnected and steam
      used for the blower and atomizer.&nbsp; The easy way to do this is to use
      a regulator on the air input line and set the air pressure to just below
      the pressure at which you want to switch to steam.&nbsp; Once the steam
      pressure is above the value of the air regulator output pressure, the
      valve between the steam turret and the atomizer manifold can be
      opened.&nbsp; The higher steam pressure will cause the check valve in the
      air input line to close&nbsp; The burner usually sputters as water is
      cleared from the steam lines and then evens out in a few
      seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the fire goes out, it should relight easily with the
      igniter.</p>
      
      <p>If a regulator is not available in the air line, the air line valve can
      be gradually closed while opening the steam input valve to the atomizer
      manifold.&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Note that the boiler comes to operating pressure quickest using
      compressed air at a pressure of 50 psi or greater and not switching to
      steam for the blower and atomizer until after operating pressure is
      reached..&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Relighting a hot burner:&nbsp; </b>If
      the fire goes out because it is too lean or too rich, it always seems to
      relight by pushing the igniter switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the fire has
      been out for more than about 30 seconds with the fuel on, it's probably
      wise to shut off the fuel for about 30 seconds to let the excess clear
      out and then push the igniter switch while opening the fuel valve until it
      relights.</font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">If the burner won't relight using the
      igniter, I get out my little torch and use the cold burner procedure.</font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Keeping Pressure when sitting:</b> The
      minimum heat output of the burner is such that if you stop and sit for a
      while, the pressure will build and the safety valves will release, which
      can be distracting if you just stopped to chat for a few
      minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One technique is to add water using the steam
      powered pump.&nbsp; The added water cools the boiler causing the pressure
      to drop.&nbsp;&nbsp; The burner can then be used to heat extra water when
      you're sitting --- storing&nbsp; energy.&nbsp;</font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">There is no problem with shutting the
      burner off for a while; just remember that your need about 20 psi to
      get the burner going again.&nbsp;&nbsp; All steam valves should be closed
      to minimize steam pressure loss when sitting.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the burner is
      off for more than a few minutes, then the torch will likely be required
      to relight it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Operation on the track:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The only
      track I've run the Shay on is Mill Creek Central Railroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Very little of that track is flat, most is on a grade with some nice long
      stretches of ~ 3% grade --- ideal for a shay.&nbsp;&nbsp; So when running
      you are either working to keep pressure when going uphill or trying to
      slow it down when going downhill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"> On the first couple runs I tried
      to juggle the throttle and steam brake to regulate the speed.&nbsp;&nbsp; That proved
      to be too much effort so I started to use the reverse lever
      to slow down when going downhill.&nbsp; That worked much better than the
      brake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Initially</font><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;
      I&nbsp; tried to adjust the blower in
      relationship to the throttle ---- open throttle --- reduce blower and vice
      versa.&nbsp; That also was too much effort.&nbsp; I ended up setting the blower for 20 to 30
      psi and adjusting the fuel for no smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the throttle is
      opened really wide, the fuel must be increased to accommodate the extra
      draft.&nbsp;&nbsp; If going really slow or stopped, the blower can be
      turned down to about 10 psi and the fuel reduced&nbsp; to keep from
      smoking&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The axel pump seems to match well with the water
      consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the last run hauling a couple cars the pump
      supplied more water than was being used so the return valve was opened
      slightly.&nbsp;&nbsp; With very heavy loads it's expected that the steam
      powered pump will be needed from time-to- time. to augment&nbsp; the axel
      pump.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
