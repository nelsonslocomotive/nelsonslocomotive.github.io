    <p align=left>Recall that I stopped work on the drive shafts and universals
    when the lathe drive belt broke.&nbsp; I made the engine mount while waiting
    for the replacement belt to arrive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finished the mount and still
    no belt so decided to finish the planned transporter and test stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>Recall that the completed locomotive will weigh over 400
    pounds so at some point I'll have to deal with moving it.&nbsp; Some months
    back Harbor Freight had a 1100 pound capacity hydraulic table on sale for
    $200.&nbsp;&nbsp; The table has large wheels and the height adjusts from
    11&quot; to 33&quot;&nbsp; This seemed to be a nice way to move the
    locomotive ---- the&nbsp; table lowered to get a low center of gravity for
    stability when moving and then be raised for construction and
    maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan was to put about 7 feet of rail on the
    top.&nbsp; The problem was that the table top is 3 feet long necessitating
    that the rails extend beyond the edge of the table --- interfering with the
    handle and hydraulic
    controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <p align=left>&nbsp;The photo above shows the modified table, now called a <b><i>Shay
    Transporter</i></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
    had rolled it out of the basement workshop onto a cedar walkway.&nbsp; (This
    photo was taken in May.&nbsp; The wife had fertilized the lawn a few&nbsp;
    weeks before&nbsp; --- against my wishes.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the spring rain,
    the grass grows about 6&quot; per day.&nbsp; Guess who cuts the
    grass?)&nbsp; The rails are 1/8&quot; X 1.5&quot; channels clamped to the
    top of the table.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are stops at each end to keep the
    locomotive from rolling off the end.&nbsp; The stops can be removed so
    that&nbsp; the locomotive can be rolled off on to a track.&nbsp; </p>

            <td width="50%">This photo shows the modifications to the hydraulic
              table.&nbsp;&nbsp; The black angles at the bottom move the handle
              and controls about 32&quot; to the rear.&nbsp; I had those angles
              on hand and are certainly overkill for this application.&nbsp;&nbsp; The orange knob
              controls the hydraulic release valve.&nbsp; It was necessary to
              make a ~32&quot; extension to the part of the shaft between the
              black angles.&nbsp; The rusty bar is an extension to the foot
              operated hydraulic pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; The foot pedal extension
              reduces the amount of lift from each pedal operation but is still
              very usable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

            <td>One of the problems I faced was being able to test the engine
              and drive train operation without a track.&nbsp; The solution was the <b><i>Test
              Fixture</i></b>
              shown on the right.&nbsp; The fixture consists of a pair of
              1/2&quot; rods welded to scraps of 1.5&quot; channels.&nbsp; Ball bearings
              are installed at the ends of the rods and retained with cotter
              pins.&nbsp; (Enco sells these ball bearings for less than $3
              each.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between the inside of the bearings on
              each rod is the 7.5&quot; track gauge.&nbsp; The wheels set on and
              are cradled between each pair of bearings. </td>

              right.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fixture can be used on the Transporter as
              well as on regular track.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fixture can also be set on
              a flat workbench.&nbsp; However, the truck would be free to pivot
              so I'm not sure that would work very well.</td>

    On second thought, it might be wise to move it outside before
    making a fire ----- the black oil soot might strain the furnace filter ----
    might also strain the spouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
