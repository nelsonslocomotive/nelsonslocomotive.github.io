      the line shaft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recall that I'm not a
      machinist&nbsp; so it's very likely I found the hard way to make the parts.</P>

            bearings are made from round SAE 841 oil impregnated bearing stock.&nbsp;
            The first step was to mill the bar to a square shape.&nbsp; This
            operation is shown on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; This turned into a real
            mess ---- puddles of oil ran out of the bronze.&nbsp; This got worse
            with each succeeding piece ---- the mill was rapidly dulling, it
            seemed more rapidly than I'd expect on steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some time
            later in a conversation with Dan Staron he commented that this type
            of bronze dulls tools quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems strange, the bronze
            is softer than steel and the oil should keep things
            cool.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I had it to do over, I'd do this on the lathe
            where the tool bit is easy to sharpen --- or use a fly cutter in the
            mill..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            reamer I had used on the main bearings through the two
            bearings.&nbsp; This reamer is made from 1/2&quot; drill rod but is flattened

              mounts on the line shafts and crankshaft.&nbsp; I started by
              cutting&nbsp;a piece of 7/8&quot; rod&nbsp; and chucking it in the
              lathe and drilling a 1/2&quot; hole through the center.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rod is extra long at this
              point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next,&nbsp; one end was cross drilled 3/8&quot; in
              the drill press.&nbsp; I found the cross drilling worked the best
              by first center punching the spot, then use a center drill to
              improve the center punch mark, then drill 1/4&quot; and finish by
              drilling 3/8&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; During these steps I repositioned&nbsp;
              the rod in the drill press vise as necessary so that
              the hole went through the center of the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              3/8&quot; drill has a tendency to grab the piece, so excitement is
              minimized if a large vise is used and it is grasped and held
              firmly.&nbsp;</td>

              flowed into the joint between the two pieces.&nbsp; However, there

              to the local welding shop to inquire about a propane burner for
              silver soldering.&nbsp; The old guy in the shop said you can't use
              propane, it doesn't get hot enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The live
              steam books say to use propane.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ignoring the welding
              guy's advice, I bought the setup shown here.&nbsp; The tank is from
              an old gas grill --- the type that the suppliers will not fill to
              use to prepare food.&nbsp; You can however get it filled to use
              with a torch.&nbsp; (If I have a half cooked steak when the

              bottle to the barbecue --- it's against the
              law!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I use the burner outside because of fumes

              the 45% silver solder in 1/32&quot; diameter and the flat
              strips.&nbsp; The pickling solutions come as dry salts like soup concentrate
              --- you just add water.&nbsp; The solutions must be heated to
              about 140 degrees F to work properly.&nbsp; A crock pot works
              great for heating the solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've also

              couple minutes to heat a part like the end of a male drive shaft
