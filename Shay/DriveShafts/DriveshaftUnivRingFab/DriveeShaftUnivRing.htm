          <td><b>Universal Rings: </b>As mentioned elsewhere, I&nbsp; used a
            different universal ring design than Kenneth.&nbsp; My design uses three rings,
            a&nbsp; 5/8&quot; thick&nbsp; 2&quot; OD/1.75&quot; ID outer ring
            and two 1/4' thick 1.75&quot; OD/1.25&quot; ID inner
            rings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

          <td>The rings are cut from tubing.&nbsp; I cut some by using a parting
            tool in the lathe.&nbsp; I found it was much quicker to cut
            over-thick slices with an abrasive cutoff saw and then true up the
            ends in the lathe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's often difficult to mount
            thin disks in the chuck.&nbsp;&nbsp; The face of my chuck is true so
            I position a spacer between the piece and the chuck face, then
            tighten the chuck followed by removing the spacer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            photo shows a spacer behind an outer
            ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            drilling template on the rotary table.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I made
            it twice; the first time the hole pattern wasn't concentric.&nbsp;
            The photo shows the pattern, note the extra eight hole
            markings.&nbsp; I also cut a 1/2&quot; thick piece of the outer tube
            to hold the inner rings for drilling.&nbsp; The OD of the inner
            rings is about 0.015&quot; smaller then the ID of the outer
            ring.&nbsp; The three brass&nbsp; strips are shims to hold the inner
            rings concentric to the outer ring.&nbsp; If both inner rings are
            positioned the same, they are aligned with each other.&nbsp; I
            drilled two holes through the target ring, inserted a couple screws
            to hold them in position and then just drilled the other six holes
            deep enough to mark the target piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

          <td>The next step was to drill the four holes in the inner rings for
            the sleeve bearings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sleeve bearings are 1/4&quot;
            long 5/16&quot; OD 1/4&quot; ID oil impregnated bronze -- McMaster-Carr
            part # 6391K126 at 23 cents each.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; two inner
            rings were first bolted together and then the location of the bearing holes
            marked.&nbsp; The marks were center punched and then a center
            drill used to deepen the mark.&nbsp; The four holes were then dilled
            with a 1/8&quot; drill.&nbsp; The 1/8 drill in the drill press was
            then used to align opposing holes.&nbsp; After the pair of holes
            were aligned, the drill press vise was tightened to hold the rings in
            position.&nbsp; The 1/8&quot; drill was then removed and a
            5/16&quot; drill used to enlarge the the two aligned holes.&nbsp; This process was
            repeated for the other pair of bearing holes in the pair of inner
            rings&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

          <td>The next step was to silver solder one of the inner rings inside
            the outer ring.&nbsp;
            The two pieces were&nbsp; cleaned in the pickling solution and then
            fluxed.&nbsp; Four pieces of flat silver solder were then inserted
            between the inner and outer ring.&nbsp; The strips were positioned
            midway between the holes for the bearings so the solder didn't flow
            into the bearing holes.&nbsp; A length of 5/16&quot;
            hex rod was used as a spacer under the inner ring when the pieces
            were heated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

          <td>The soldered pieces were then cleaned in the pickling solution and
            four 1/8&quot; oil holes drilled in the outer ring. &nbsp; The other inner ring was sawed in half.&nbsp; The
            completed ring with bearings is shown on the right.&nbsp; I
            was unable to make the bearing holes identical in all the pieces.&nbsp;
            Therefore,
            each of the split rings is marked so that it can be associated with
            the correct mate.&nbsp; (No worry, auto engine bearing caps and
            connecting rod bearing caps are also not interchangeable and marked
            in a similar way.)

            design on the female slip joints.&nbsp; I started with 7/8&quot; bar
            stock.&nbsp; The bar was cut to the proper length and then chucked
            in the lathe where the ends were finished and then the inside
            drilled 1/2&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step was to mill a slot in the end
            for the pin that interfaces with the universal ring.&nbsp; Here is a
            place where I deviated from Kenneth's design, I ran the pin across
            the diagonal rather than the flat

            Rather than milling off the 3/16&quot;,&nbsp; most the thickness was sawed off and then&nbsp; finished with the end mill.&nbsp;
