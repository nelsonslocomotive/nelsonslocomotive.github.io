      <P align=left>Around Thanksgiving 2005 Robert Calhoon&nbsp; sent a 
      set of 6 Shay gear guards he had made.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;next photo shows one of 
      the guards.</P>
      <P align=center>

                    <div>
                      Robert included the following instructions: 
                      <p>The upper brackets have two # 43 drill holes&nbsp; 
                      which can&nbsp;be used as drill guides&nbsp;for drilling the 
                      mounting holes in the top of the journal box.&nbsp; The guard should 
                      be on the bracket when using it as a drill guide. The 
                      bracket should fit on the 1/4 inch shelf with the holes 
                      lined up with the two vertical ribs on the journal box. 
                      &nbsp;After the holes in the journal box have been drilled and 
                      tapped 4-40, the brackets should be re-drilled #33.
                      <p>The lower bracket is mounted on the cover with 4-40 
                      screws, making sure the screws do not &nbsp;put pressure on the 
                      bearing. The lower bracket is secured to the guard with 
                      soft solder. The assembly is then removed from the journal 
                      box and drilled through the bracket from the back and 
                      the bracket tapped for a 4-40 screw.
                      <p>I followed Robert's instructions except for soft 
                      soldering the bracket to the guard.&nbsp; After mounting 
                      the bracket and the guard I drilled through the guard into 
                      the bracket with a #43 drill.&nbsp; I tapped the hole in 
                      the bracket 4-40 and enlarged the hole in the guard with a 
                      #33 drill.&nbsp; I used button head cap screws through 
                      the guard into the brackets.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brackets were 
                      attached to the truck with hex head screws.

                      The drawing above shows the three pieces of Robert's 
                      gear guard design.&nbsp;&nbsp; I measured the dimensions 
                      from the pieces and they might be off slightly.&nbsp; The 
                      hole for the screw through the guard into the lower 
                      bracket is not show.&nbsp;&nbsp; This hole will be 
                      drilled after the brackets and guard have been attached 
                      to the truck.<p>&nbsp;<p align="center">

                      Robert was kind enough to pass on the above photo of the 
                      die he used to form the guard.&nbsp; His described the 
                      process as follows:
    
                      The guards are made of 1/16&quot; X 1&quot; brass which is available at our local 
        Ace Hardware
     
        store.&nbsp; The brass is heated until it glows and then quenched in water.&nbsp; 
                      A 
        5&quot; piece is then partially bent and placed in the forming fixture and 
                      forced closed in an arbor press. The 
                      fixture&nbsp;and brass are then placed in a vise and the mounting tab 
                      bent about 45 degrees with a hammer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brass 
                      is then 
                      re-heated,&nbsp;quenched, and pressed again&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                      The tab is then finished by bending it to 90 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
                      <p>Robert --- thanks for the guards and also for the 
                      process which I'll be able to apply to other projects.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;<CENTER>
