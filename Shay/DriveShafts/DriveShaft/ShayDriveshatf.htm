      <P align=left><font face="Arial">The new lathe drive belt finally arrived
      so I was able to finish and document this part before I have to
      shelve the project for a few weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></P>
      <P align=left><font face="Arial"><b>Line Shafts: </b>A line shaft
      subsystem consisting of bearings, line shaft, bevel gears, collars and
      spacers is located on the right side of each
      truck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subsystem for the middle
      truck is shown below.&nbsp;&nbsp; The truck is setting on the test
      fixture.&nbsp; (I see I left one of the screws off the rear bearing cover
      plate.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></P>
      <P align=center><img border="0" src="Lineshaft1.jpg" width="699" height="341"></P>
    <P align=left>This shows the second attempt at assembling the line
    shafts.&nbsp; The first time I used 3/16&quot; diameter expansion pins to
    hold the pinion gears and collars to the line shaft.&nbsp; The pieces must
    have slipped when I drilled the holes and the result was
    unsatisfactory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before redoing the shaft I checked everything
    very carefully to make sure I wouldn't have to do it the third time.&nbsp;
    It was at that point I discovered that I had mounted the pinion gears behind
    the axel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dumb!&nbsp; <b>The pinion gears go in front of the
    axels as shown in the photo.</b>&nbsp; That made the redo less painful since
    I had to fix two problems.&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=left>I decided to use set screws in the redo.&nbsp; Since I had
    already drilled 3/16&quot;: holes through the gears and collars, the minimum
    size set screw I could use was 1/4&quot; diameter.&nbsp; I chose
    1/4&quot;-28 dog point set screws for the bevel gears and 1/4&quot;-28
    hollow set screws for the collars.&nbsp; The dog point is ~ 3/16&quot;
    diameter so it should have the same holding force as the expansion
    pin.&nbsp; With the two set screws, I can tighten one to hold the gear and
    drill the 1/8&quot; deep hole for the dog point of the other set screw ---
    then inset that set screw, remove the first set screw and drill the hole for
    that dog point.&nbsp; The forces on the collars are less so I'm hoping the
    hollow point set screws will hold them in
    place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top">The photo above shows the assembled line shaft
            removed from the middle truck.&nbsp; There is a pinion gear, spacer,
            bronze bearing and collar for each axel.&nbsp; The spacer between
            the bearing and the gear controls the amount the pinion meshes with
            the gear on the wheel.&nbsp; The collar on the other side of each
            bearing holds the pinion gear and spacer against the the
            bearing.&nbsp; The bearing rides in a slot in the right side journal
            boxes as shown in the photo on the right.&nbsp; The bearing is
            not a tight fit --- there is a small amount of float.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The plate holds the bearing in the journal box.&nbsp; Each bearing
            has a round stub on the side that fits in the axel hole in the
            journal.&nbsp; This novel design permits the bearing to rotate
            slightly as necessary when the axel moves up and down over
            variations in the track while preventing the bearing moving to the front or
            rear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

          <td valign="top"><b>Universals: </b> I examined the universals very
            carefully on my visit to Cass this spring.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of these
            universals is shown on the right.&nbsp; The visible part is a single
            casting.&nbsp; There are bronze sleeve bearings (not visible) on the
            ends of the drive shafts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The eight bolts hold a&nbsp;
            split removal disk on the other side of the universal.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            When the bolts are removed, the universals can be removed from the
            truck and the bearings accessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <p>The three photos below show one of my universals.&nbsp; The split
            disk is removed in the left photo to expose the bearings.&nbsp; It's
            pretty close match to the full size universal.&nbsp; Once it's been
            in use for a few hours and dirt mixes in with the dripping oil,
            it'll be indistinguishable from the real thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>My universal is a little larger diameter than Kenneth's (but
            smaller than the prototype) necessitating that the truck bottom tie bar be
            mounted under the angles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Kenneth's drawings showed similar recesses in his drive shafts. I was unhappy with
