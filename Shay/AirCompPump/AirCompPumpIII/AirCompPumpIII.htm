      <p>The cylinders pistons and water valves were completed in
      Part II.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could have stopped at that point and used the parts as a
      fake air compressor.&nbsp; However, its still cold outside so might as
      well try to make the thing work .&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp; on to the tough part --- the steam
      valves.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pilot valve cylinder was done first, then the&nbsp; shuttle valve cylinder and then
      the two were joined.&nbsp; After that,
      a few minor details such as the little valves, the shuttle valve pistons,
      shuttle valve heads, etc.</p>

            <td><b>Shuttle Valve Pistons:</b>&nbsp; This&nbsp; photo shows the
              shuttle valve pistons and the shuttle valve.&nbsp; The pistons are
              connected with a 2-56 threaded rod.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 2-56
              screws in the end of the pistons to serve as stops for the
              threaded rod.&nbsp; After everything has been checked out,&nbsp;
              these end screws will be secured with hi temperature
              Loctite.&nbsp; The screw head can then be used to take apart the
              two pistons.&nbsp; The grove in the pistons was cut to make the
              O-Ring fit looser then normal so there pistons slide fairly
              easily.&nbsp; The cylinder bore was
              0.456&quot; and the O-Ring grove diameter was 0.320&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Update 
            2/23/2006:</b> I replaced the EPDM O-Rings with Viton O-Rings.&nbsp; 
            When I did that I found the&nbsp; fit loose --- no seal at all.&nbsp; 
            I remade the piston with a groove ID of 0.335&quot; which worked but slid 
            very easily. It might be best to start with a depth if 0.34&quot; and 
            then reduce it if the piston is too tight<b>. End Update. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>

              screws, and it wasn't another&nbsp; miscalculation.&nbsp; The
              first choice was 4 screws but the location of the steam feed
              required that the screws not be align with the horizontal or
              vertical and I thought it'd look sloppy.&nbsp; The prototype used
              5 holes and with 5 holes, any alignment looks OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;
