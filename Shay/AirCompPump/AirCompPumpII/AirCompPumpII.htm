      <p><b>Design Decisions:&nbsp;</b> There's snow on the ground so it's too
      cold to do any more steaming tests of the shay, a good time to finish up the plumbing
      and then start painting the trucks, frames and engine ----- and make
      an&nbsp; air compressor that pumps water rather than air.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a
      touch of flue just before Christmas (or maybe it was shock after making my
      annual visit to the mall)&nbsp; so sat down and sketched out the pump
      components with emphasis on how to make the valves for both the steam and
      water cylinders.&nbsp;&nbsp; This turned out to be an iterative process
      and along the way decided to use EPDM O-Rings for rings and seals on both
      the steam and water sides of the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is to attempt to
      follow the Westinghouse pilot and shuttle valve design and to try to make
      the exterior of the valves resemble the Westinghouse units.&nbsp; Teflon was
      selected for the slide valves.&nbsp; The water pump valves will be a
      duplicate of the valve Kenneth uses on the Shay axel pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      following is a summary of these design
      decisions:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The tricky parts of the pump are the valves, both water and steam.&nbsp;
      One approach would be to make the valves first and then complete the easy
      part.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another approach would be to make the cylinders,
      heads&nbsp; and pistons and then use that as motivation to make the valves (and
      remake as necessary)&nbsp; to finish the project.&nbsp;&nbsp; I took the
      second approach.&nbsp; If nothing else, I'll have a realistic
      decoration.&nbsp;</p>

              held in the chuck as shown on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the

              then the ends of both cylinders finished and then the steam cylinder
              bored.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was pretty careful to not screw up this part

      <p><b>Update 5/16/04: </b>After some use&nbsp; under steam power the pump
      started to run really slow.&nbsp; A few drops of silicone brake fluid
      speeded it up for a few minutes but then it slowed down again.&nbsp; A
      lubricator seemed like a real pain.&nbsp; The pump was disassembled and
      the steam piston was found to be hard to push. A little water made it
      easier to push but still pretty tight.&nbsp;&nbsp; The depth of the O-Ring
      grove was according to specifications from the <a href="http://www.marcorubber.com/">Marco
      Rubber</a> website--- but that was for a tight seal.&nbsp; For this
      application a slight leak is tolerable so the grove depth was increased to
      give a&nbsp; 0.100 allowance for the O-Ring --- a loose seal for the
      0.103&quot; O-Ring cross section.&nbsp; That seemed to fix the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The grove on the water piston had been sized to the minimum of the recommended
      squeeze on the Marco website and was not changed. &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>End Update.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Update 2/23/2006:</b> I replaced the EPDM O-Rings with Viton O-Rings 
      in the steam cylinder and valves and a Buna-N O-ring on the water piston.&nbsp; 
      The EPDM&nbsp; O-Rings had softened and become sticky.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also 
      added a lubricator as described in Part IV.&nbsp; <b>End Update.&nbsp; </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The steam valves
      are
      next ---- in Part III.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
