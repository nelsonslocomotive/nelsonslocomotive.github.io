          <td><b>Valve Test: </b>I decided to test the steam valves at this
            point before going any further with the fabrication.&nbsp; The pilot
            valve stem assembly in the upper photo was made from 3/16&quot;
            brass and a 2-56 threaded rod (screw with head cut off).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower photo
            shows the valve assembly with the end of one 3/16&quot; brass rod
            sticking out below the head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compressed air was
            then connected via the hose and the valve operation tested by
            pushing and pulling the 3/16&quot; rod.&nbsp; Well, it didn't
            work,&nbsp; and there seem to be air leaks everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
            took it apart and double checked everything ---- nothing seemed to
            be amiss.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a last resort I verified that the air was
            connected to the input port.&nbsp; Damn! Should have checked that
            first.
            <p>Once air was supplied to the input port the valve worked as
            expected (maybe hoped is more correct).&nbsp;&nbsp; The shuttle
            operated with some authority with as little as about 15
            psi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    <p align="left"><b>Update 5/16/04:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The pump failed several
    times due to the pilot valve rod and the connection between the shuttle
    valve pistons working loose.&nbsp; I finally bit the bullet and took apart
    each joint and applied high temperature Loctite (620) which seems to have
    fixed the problem. <b>End update. </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
     
    <p align="left">The valve stem is removed by inserting a hex wrench up
    through the the lower end of the piston rod and a flat blade screwdriver down
    through the top of the pilot valve cylinder into the screw head above the
    valve.&nbsp; The joint inside the piston rod can then be unscrewed and the
    stem with the valve can then be pulled up and out the top of the pilot valve
    cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
     
    <p align="left">The pilot valve can be removed using the following
    procedure:&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Remove the cap and bushing at the top of the pilot valve
        cylinder</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Remove the lower pump cylinder head.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Remove the set screw in the bottom of the piston rod.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Push the piston to the upper extreme position.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Insert a hex wrench or small rod in the piston rod and
        push the valve stem to the upper position.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">With both the piston and valve stem in the upper
        position,&nbsp; much of the valve stem and the valve&nbsp; sticks out
        above the top of the pilot cylinder. The valve can then be pulled away
        from the stem</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Once the valve has been removed, the upper head can be
        removed if necessary.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">This procedure can be reversed to reinstall the
        valve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p align="left"><b>First Steam Test (using compressed air):</b> The&nbsp; steam side of the system was then assembled and
    tested on compressed air.&nbsp; It didn't work very well --- it was very erratic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I then put a little water in the air line and it straightened right and
    worked pretty well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The water serves to lubricate everything and
    help the valves seal.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was curious how the system would work
    with a little lubricant.&nbsp; Petroleum based&nbsp; lubricants are not compatible
    with the EPDM O-Rings but brake fluid is so I tried a half dozen drops in
    the air line.&nbsp; Wow! The thing took of and was really smooth, worked
    down to a few pounds of air pressure.&nbsp; I let it run for a half hour or
    so and it worked great, never hung up once.&nbsp; I then installed the water pump cylinder
    and piston and it continued to operate great.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">After this successful test&nbsp; I took a break.&nbsp; Later
    I tried it again and it was erratic again.&nbsp; The valve seemed to be
    working but the steam piston seemed to be hanging up.&nbsp; Pulled the
    piston and found the O-Ring had turned soft and failed.&nbsp; Then I
    remembered,&nbsp; McMaster Carr doesn't carry the high temperature EPDM
    version of the #121 O-Ring so I got a bag of 100 of #121 Buna-N O-Rings for
    a couple dollars.&nbsp; This test confirmed the O-Ring literature; Buna-N is
    not compatible with brake fluid.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The plan was to order the correct O-Ring from <a href="http://www.marcorubber.com/" target="_top"> Marco Rubber</a>
    once I was sure of the correct size.&nbsp; Marco seems to have a minimum
    price of $10 per item.&nbsp; In this case one of the O-Rings is $10 and one
    can also buy 100 of the #121 O-Rings for $10.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also need some of the #008 size
    used for the valve stem seals and can get 100 of these for $10 and 500 for
    $10.40.&nbsp; (I had a bunch of the #008 in the 200
    degree max temperature EPDM that I'd used in brake systems.&nbsp; McMaster
    Carr doesn't carry the #008 size in the higher temperature EPDM
    either.&nbsp;)&nbsp; Guess I'm going to end up with a few hundred spare O-Rings.&nbsp;
    <b>&nbsp;Update 2/23/2006:</b>&nbsp; I changed the O-Rings to Viton for 
    everything except the water piston&nbsp; which was changed to Buna-N.&nbsp; 
    I obtained the Viton and Buna-N O-Rings from&nbsp; from McMaster-Carr. <b>
    End Update</b>.</p>
    <p align="left">The brake fluid lubricant worked great so that I'm considering
    building a&nbsp; lubricator.&nbsp; Also, a few drops of that stuff might loosen
    up those steam brake pistons a bit --- makes sense, brake fluid for brake
    cylinders.&nbsp; However, the polyglycol ether based braked fluids
    (DOT3, DOT4 &amp; DOT5.1) are some of the most effective paint
    removers known to man.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't want that stuff around my
    locomotive since I hope to paint it someday.&nbsp; These brake fluids are soluble in water
    so the lubrication might also wash off pretty easily.&nbsp; An alternative
    is the silicone brake fluid (DOT5).&nbsp; The silicone fluid is harmless to
    paint and isn't soluble in water.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, maybe a lubricator that
    uses the silicone fluid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some further tests are in
    order.&nbsp;<b>Update:2/23/2006:</b> After changing the steam side O-Rings 
    to Viton I was able to use standard steam oil for lubrication.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    See added lubricator at the end. <b>End Update.&nbsp; </b></p>

            soldered in the slot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The holes in the ends of the

    <p align="left"><b>Update 1/30/2004:&nbsp;</b> Yesterday (1/29/2004) I used
    the pump on compressed air to fill the boiler and then wheeled the
    locomotive outside in the 15 degree (F) weather to do a steaming test.&nbsp;
    The pump worked on steam just as it did on compressed air.&nbsp; With the
    cold temperature it was easy to spot two steam leaks.&nbsp;&nbsp; One leak
    was from the slot I milled for the mounting bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; This milled
    slot cut through the steam passage from the shuttle valve to the bottom of
    the steam cylinder.&nbsp; The mounting bar was silver soldered in place
    which sealed the steam passage except for a pin hole.&nbsp; The other leak
    was from the joint between the valve case and the upper head.&nbsp; The pump
    was disassembled later and the pin hole was soldered&nbsp; shut.&nbsp; A
    high spot was found that kept the valve case from seating on the head.&nbsp;
    After the high spot was filed off the valve case/head joint
    sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
     
    <p align="left">There was no problem starting the pump.&nbsp; The pump was
    started and then stopped and allowed to cool a half dozen times.&nbsp; There
    was clearly condensate&nbsp; in the valves and cylinder that didn't seem to interfere
    with starting even at very low pressure.&nbsp; After the two leaks were
    fixed the pump was submerged in water to allow the steam cylinder and valves to
    fill with water.&nbsp; The pump started on less than 50 pounds pressure
    every time, even under water .&nbsp; This thing is reliable!</p>
     
    <p align="left"><b>Update 6/6/04:&nbsp;</b> The
    pump started to run really slow.&nbsp; A few drops of silicone brake fluid
    in the steam line speeded it up for a few minutes but then it slowed down
    again.&nbsp; A lubricator seemed like a real pain.&nbsp; The pump was
    disassembled and the steam piston was found to be hard to push. A little
    water made it easier to push but still pretty tight.&nbsp;&nbsp; The depth
    of the gland was according to specifications --- but that was for a tight
    seal.&nbsp; For this application a slight leak is tolerable so the gland
    depth was increased to 0.100&quot; --- a loose seal for the 0.103&quot;
    O-Ring cross section.&nbsp; The pump has run flawlessly after this fix and
    the application of Loctite to the valve joints.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          previously, the EPDM O-Rings became sticky after a couple years of use 
          so I changed to Viton O-Rings on the steam piston, steam valves and 
          rod seals.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also added the displacement lubricator shown 
          on the right.&nbsp; The lubricator was obtained from American Model 
          Engineering Supply, model DLU4.&nbsp; The unit seems to run a bit 
          freer than before.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
