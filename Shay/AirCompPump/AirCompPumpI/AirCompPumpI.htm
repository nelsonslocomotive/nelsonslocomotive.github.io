      <p>My grandfather immigrated from Germany in the late 1800s to work in
      George Westinghouse's Pittsburgh laboratory.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the
      products of that laboratory was the railcar air brake systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Grandpa apparently worked at Westinghouse for only a short time before he
      started his own business down the river a few miles.&nbsp; (Don't know
      whether grandpa quit or was fired.)&nbsp;&nbsp; This very loose family
      connection to the air brake systems stimulated an interest in the steam powered air compressors.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Most of the shays were equipped with an air compressor so I want one to
      decorate my shay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some working scale models of the air compressor
      are designed to pump water --- feed water pumps.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the
      first&nbsp; steaming tests I had to use the hand pump and quickly began to lust for a steam powered pump or
      an injector.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen several of the steam powered pumps made
      by Keim Steam Pumps and sold by <a href="http://www.locoparts.net/newpump2.htm">Loco
      Parts</a> .&nbsp; These pumps are models of the Westinghouse 9 1/2 inch
      compressor.&nbsp; The Keim pumps seem to run really great and they look
      fabulous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cass No 5 which I've copied many details uses
      the slightly larger 11 inch pump.&nbsp; The 9&quot; pump has cooling fins on the
      air compressor (which Keim models exquisitely) whereas the as 11&quot; compressor has smooth sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; The smart
      solution would be to
      buy one of the Keim pumps.&nbsp; However, it's winter and I need a new
      challenge so I decided to try to make a working air compressor model that
      pumps water.</p>
      <p>I've been thinking about these pumps since I started to build the
      shay.&nbsp; One of the challenges was to understand the valve mechanism
      that insures the pump operates reliably.&nbsp;&nbsp; To this end I scoured
      my limited resources and came up with several useful references.&nbsp; The July 1976 issue of <u>Narrow
      Gauge and Short Line Gazette&nbsp;</u>&nbsp; has dimensioned drawings of
      the more common Westinghouse compressors in fairly regular section called <i>Straight
      Talk About Bent Pipes</i> by Charles Givens.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to
      enlarge the drawings of the 11&quot; pump to 1/8 scale --- full size for
      my shay.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also found a single cylinder feed water pump design
      in the 5-18 January 1973 issue of <u>Model Engineer</u>.&nbsp; This pump
      is in an article<i> A Locomotive with Bremme Valve Gear </i>by Gilbert
      Lindsey<i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>  The concept of a pilot valve and shuttle
      valve is described in this article. The pilot valve mechanical linkage on this
      pump is external.&nbsp; The pilot valve is driven by the piston
      rod with the motion of the valve much less than the piston.&nbsp; The pilot valves on the Westinghouse
      pumps are directly above the steam piston.&nbsp; The valve should move only when the piston is near the upper or
      lower extremes of its motion.&nbsp; I read someplace
      that the concept of a large
      piston motion driving a small valve motion near the extremes of the piston
      motion is called
      &quot;lost motion&quot;.&nbsp; I tried for months to figure out how the lost
      motion was achieved until I concluded that the rod
      connecting the steam and air compressor pistons must be hollow&nbsp; with the
      valve stem sliding inside the piston rod.&nbsp; That
      way, the valve stem could be rigged to be pushed or pulled at the two
      extremes of the piston motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after I figured this
      out I saw a cross section sketch of a duplex Westinghouse pump on the
      inside rear cover of the March/April 2003 issue of <u>Live Steam</u>.&nbsp;
      This sketch (in a Grand Scale advertisement) clearly shows the the hollow
      piston rod on the high pressure steam side of the pump,&nbsp; confirming my
      guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The pilot valve controls the steam and exhaust to the steam operated
      shuttle valve.&nbsp; The shuttle valve has the sliding valve sandwiched
      between two pistons that pull the valve between the two extreme
      positions.&nbsp; The shuttle valve should snap between the two extreme
      positions and then be fairly stable in those positions.&nbsp; With the
      stable position of the shuttle valve at the two extremes, full steam
      pressure is always supplied to one of the two ends of the main cylinder
      making it self starting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <td><b>Cass 5 Air Pump:&nbsp; </b>This is a photo of the 11&quot;
              air pump on Cass No 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper cylinder is for steam
              and the lower cylinder is the air pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both
              pistons&nbsp; are 11&quot; diameter and the stroke is
              12&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The increased outside dimensions of the upper cylinder is
              probably due to lagging that is covered with a jacket.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              steam valves are at the top of the steam cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
              compressor valves must be on the back side of the compressor.</td>

      from some Westinghouse publication and I'm not likely violating any

      <p>This is a good point to break.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pump
