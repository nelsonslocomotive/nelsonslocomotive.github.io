      <p align=left>The Lubricator&nbsp; injects oil into the engine intake
      header to lubricate the sliding valves, piston rings and cylinder walls.
      A very small amount of oil is required but the pressure must be
      sufficient to overcome the steam pressure.&nbsp; Two types of lubricators
      are commonly used on live steam locomotives, the displacement lubricator
      and the mechanical (pump) lubricator.&nbsp;&nbsp; The displacement
      lubricator is a fairly simple device with no moving parts but is not
      typically used for the locomotive engine -- not sure why. The mechanical
      lubricator is a simple small pump.</p>
    <p align=left>I had just prepared an order for all the pluming parts (valves,
    unions, taps &amp; dies, elbows, etc.) and was suffering sticker
    shock.&nbsp; This project was beginning to become a money pit.&nbsp; But
    when compared to the real money pit (a woman) it's a bargain at twice the price.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, thought I should
    maybe economize and build my lubricator since they seem to be selling for
    about $150.&nbsp; Also, I wanted to be make the tank so it would match the locomotive
    aesthetics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>I haven't noticed a mechanical lubricator on any of the shays
    I've seen.&nbsp; Next time to Cass I'll have to look more closely.&nbsp;
    However, did snap the following photo of the lubricator on the big Heisler
    at Cass.&nbsp;</p>

    <p align=left>That' a new boiler they're installing.&nbsp; The link connects
    indirectly to one of the valve eccentrics.&nbsp; As you can see, there are
    many oil lines.&nbsp; I assume there are many little pumps in the lubricator
    tank.&nbsp; Next time will have to look more closely.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>Live steam mechanical lubricators are driven by a eccentric
    on an axel or by the engine valve mechanism.&nbsp; In most cases the pump rate
    is much less than the rate of the driving mechanism.&nbsp; This speed
    reduction is typically achieved using a ratchet wheel where each input
    stroke advances the ratchet wheel one tooth and the pump is driven one stroke
    per ratchet wheel rotation.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left><b>The Design:</b> I next looked up the lubricator in Kozo Hiraoka's <u>Building
    the Heisler</u>. (I prefer to use the Heisler text since the dimensions are
    in inches; his Shay and Climax texts are in metric.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can make
    the&nbsp; conversions, but why bother if I don't have to.)&nbsp;&nbsp; For
    his 3/4&quot; scale Heisler Hiraoka uses a 40 tooth ratchet wheel, a 3/32&quot;&nbsp;
    pump piston and a 1/4&quot; stroke.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>The 1.5&quot; Shay will need more oil.&nbsp; The cylinder
    surface at 1.5&quot; scale is 4 times the area of the 3/4&quot; scale
    assuming identical cylinders.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shay has three cylinders vs.
    the two Heisler cylinders so should have 50% more for a total of 6 times the
    oil as Hiraoka's Heisler.</p>
    <p align=left>Hiraoka fabricates his ratchet wheel from tool steel that he
    then hardens.&nbsp; That looked like a lot of work.&nbsp; Then I noticed
    that Coles lists a lubricator ratchet wheel --- 35 teeth - 7/16&quot;
    diameter.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when I tried to order the ratchet wheel I was
    told it is no longer available. Rats!.&nbsp; Then I remembered some small
    spur gears I had --- figured I could used the Dermel abrasive cutoff disk to
    shape the gear teeth to ratchet teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got out the
    Dremel tool bits I noticed the #199 high speed steel cutter ---- 3/8&quot;
    diameter, 1/32&quot; thick and&nbsp; 16 teeth --- on a 1/8&quot;
    shaft.&nbsp;<b><i> I found my ratchet wheel with shaft!&nbsp;</i></b> (Interesting note:
    Hiraoka has a photo of using that very same Dremel cutter to machine a slot
    in his Heisler lubricator tank for the sliding cover. The photo is beside
    the diagram showing how he machines his ratchet.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>The 16 teeth vs. 40 teeth of Hiraoka's design will make the
    pumping 2.5 times faster.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the piston (plunger) is increased from
    3/32&quot; to 3/16&quot;,&nbsp; the output will increase&nbsp; by the square
    of the diameter ratio or about&nbsp; 4 times.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the
    combination of bigger piston and fewer teeth will increase output by 2.5
    times 4&nbsp; or a total of 10 times --- that's overkill.&nbsp; However, as
    I looked at all the areas where there can be slack plus the problems with
    getting the stroke of the piston exactly aligned with the feed holes in the
    side of the cylinder, I decided to go with this size.&nbsp; If it uses too
    much oil, I can file off the end of the piston, which will have the same
    effect as reducing the stroke.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>The rest of the lubricator requires stock material except a
    steel ball --- 1/4&quot; should be OK -- have some that I bought for the
    axel pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiraoka
    specifies the spring for 1.5&quot; scale as 7/32&quot; OD, 9/16&quot; long
    with 9 turns of 0.016&quot; wire.&nbsp;&nbsp; McMaster- Carr lists a 1&quot;
    long spring, 1/4&quot; OD with 0.20&quot; wire size,&nbsp; $5.74 a dozen.
    The fully compressed length is 0.28&quot; so they must have about 14
    turns.&nbsp; Close enough.&nbsp; (Later I found a nearly identical spring in
    an old spring assortment I bought years ago.&nbsp; I decided to use it.) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>The next step was to figure out where to mount the
    lubricator.&nbsp; Kenneth mounted his on the right running board just ahead
    of the engine and drives it from the forward most valve mechanism. &nbsp; If
    I mounted my lubricator in the same spot, the ratchet wheel will be exposed
    and it's not going to be the nicest thing to look at since there was nothing like it on
    the prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, there is a protrusion out the
    bottom of the lubricator that contains the check valve spring and the outlet
    so I'd have to make a big hole in the running board.&nbsp;&nbsp; After
    looking at the alternatives for a few minutes I realized that it will mount
    nicely under that running board.&nbsp;&nbsp; The protrusion out the bottom would
    be no problem and the routing of the output pipe would be
    simplified.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ratchet wheel would be mostly hidden between the tank
    side and one of those triangle supports and the linkage to the eccentric would be
    short and direct.&nbsp; I'm thinking about a 2 inch square by
    1.5&quot; high tank.&nbsp; That size tank would set back 1&quot; from the
    edge of the running board and be the same height as the frame I
    Beam.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tank can be attached to the side of the
    frame I beam&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>The last problem is a way to fill the tank.&nbsp; One thought
    is to just put a fill pipe up through the running board with a plug in the
    end.&nbsp; The plug could be removed to inspect the oil level.&nbsp; I'm
    going to have to think about that for a while.</p>
    <p align=left><b>Drive Mechanism:&nbsp;</b>The drive mechanism consists of
    the ratchet wheel, drive lever with spring paw, a fixed spring paw, a
    bearing and crank to drive the pump piston.&nbsp; Thought I'd start with the
    lever and then realized that the lever length had to be calculated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The ratchet can be driven from the valve stem ---&nbsp; a link can be
    screwed&nbsp; into the lower end of the valve stem below the set screw that holds
    the link pin.&nbsp;&nbsp; The valve stem provides a lift of 3/8&quot;&nbsp; The ratchet wheel has
    16 teeth so the wheel must be rotated 22.5 degrees with each
    stroke.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recall that the arc length is radius times the angle in
    radians (aren't you glad you didn't sleep in math class).&nbsp; The 22.5
    degrees converts to ~0.4 radians.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the lever length to get
    22.5 degrees from a 3/8&quot; lift is .375&quot; divided by 0.4
    radians,&nbsp; ~0.094&quot;.&nbsp; At that length, we'll just make the
    required rotation assuming no float (slop) in the linkage.&nbsp; A lever
    half this length would rotate it past two teeth, assuming no float in the
    linkage.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, probably want a lever arm some place between
    0.5&quot; and 0.8&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll make two settings, 0.6&quot;, 0.75&quot;
    and then tune it up when installed.&nbsp; (A shorter radius was required for
    reliable operation as we'll see later.)</p>

    <p><b>Pump:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The major piece of the pump is the pump
    body&nbsp; which contains the cylinder in the upper half and check valve consisting of
    ball and spring in the lower half.&nbsp;&nbsp; About one third the pump
    body&nbsp; is
    inside the tank, the other two thirds below. Half the cylinder is located inside the tank and
    severs as a guide for the piston.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are four holes in the
    side of the cylinder just above the the floor to allow oil to enter the
    cylinder.&nbsp; At the upper
    most part of the stroke the bottom of the piston is just above these holes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The piston stroke is about 0.275&quot;,
    most of which in below the floor.&nbsp; The cylinder bore must extend at least
    the 0.275&quot; stroke below the holes.&nbsp; The ball check valve is at the
    bottom of the cylinder bore pushed up by a spring.&nbsp; There is a bottom
    plug to provide access to spring and ball.&nbsp; The output is through the
    side just below the ball.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With these data and the parts already made I was able to set some
    parameters as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The pump cylinder unit extends 5/8&quot; above the inside of the
        tank floor.</li>
      <li>Assume the tank floor to be 1/16' (0.06&quot;) thick.</li>
      <li>The oil input holes located just above the floor are 5/64&quot;</li>
      <li>The pump cylinder unit hangs down 13/16&quot; below the floor (7/8&quot; below the lower side of holes).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>The cylinder bore extends 5/16&quot; below the the lower side&nbsp; of
        the holes
        (this provides a little margin).</li>
      <li>The bottom end is plugged with a 3/8-24 brass bolt</li>
      <li>The output port is a 1/8&quot; MTP threaded hole.</li>
      <li>The cylinder unit is made from 3/4&quot; brass rod stock&nbsp;</li>
      <li>The cylinder bore is 3/16&quot;.</li>
      <li>The part of cylinder inside the tank is turned to 3/8&quot; and
        threaded 3/8-24.</li>
      <li>A standard 3/8-24 nut is used to secure cylinder unit to tank floor.</li>
      <li>The check valve ball
        is 1/4&quot; diameter (had some).</li>
      <li>The spring is ~7/32&quot; OD and ~1&quot; long.</li>
      <li>The piston (plunger) is a piece of 3/16&quot; drill rod.</li>
      <li>The piston is cut long and will be trimmed as necessary after pump
        assembled.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>&nbsp;The crank pin follower at the top of the piston is fabricated
        from 1/4&quot; X 1/2&quot; brass flat bar stock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

            between the bottom of the cylinder and the 3/8&quot; threads (for
            the plug)&nbsp; was
            bored to ~9/32&quot; with the top flat to make a good seat for the ball.&nbsp; Before assembly,&nbsp; the ball was put in position and then
            tapped with a punch to make a seat.&nbsp;&nbsp; The side

            a 1/8&quot; pipe cap and silver soldered in a brass rod and then machined
            it into the plug.&nbsp; The black thing is a sealing washer make
            from a scrap of Delrin rod. The plug&nbsp;is drilled 1/4&quot; on the inside for the

    <p align=left><b>Assembly:&nbsp; </b>The assembly was straightforward: drill
    holes for pump body, bearing and the screws that hold fixed paw.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Next, mounted the unit to the frame and worked on the linkage.&nbsp;
    After several attempts, the design was changed by drilling another hole in
    the lever arm to make the lever shorter and the position of the lever arm and
    fixed paw were reversed --- the lever is now at the front.&nbsp; I then made
    a link from the lever to the lower screw&nbsp; that connects
    the link blade to the eccentric strap.&nbsp; That worked pretty well but the
    adjustment was touchy to make the lubricator work when the eccentric strap
    was changed from forward to reverse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>As you see ----- there were a number of changes in the project as I went
    from conception to the running unit.&nbsp; This is normal;&nbsp; that's why
    engineers and designers use laboratories.&nbsp;&nbsp; (It's also frustrating
    at times.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dremel cutter worked great for a ratchet
    wheel.&nbsp; Other possibilities are small diameter slitting saws and small
    woodruff key slot cutters.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next time I'll use 9/16&quot; hex
    stock for the body.&nbsp;&nbsp; The part of the pump body that hangs below the
    tank can also be made&nbsp; 1/4&quot; or so shorter.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I had only two
    cylinders (thinking of a Climax or Heisler) I'd probably go with 5/32&quot;
    piston and 7/32&quot; ball.&nbsp; That would allow the threads on each end
    the pump to be reduced to 5/16&quot; and, in that case, I'd use 1/2&quot;
    hex stock for the body.&nbsp; As noted, the razor blades don't hold up very
    well ---- they became too brittle and break easily.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will order
    some spring steel and replace the paws before I have to really depend on the
    pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some vendors sell powder coated lubricators;
    that sounds like a good ideal for the tank.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;I plan
    to powder coat much of the Shay.&nbsp; ( Home powder coating is easy, see: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.buckeyetriumphs.org/technical/PowderCoating/powder_coating_equipment.htm" target="_blank">http://www.buckeyetriumphs.org/technical/PowderCoating/powder_coating_equipment.htm</a>
    ) </p>
    <p>I tested the pump and it does in fact work -- a drop dribbles out every
    rotation of ratchet.&nbsp;When I covered the 1/8&quot; output nipple with a
    finger,&nbsp; I could feel two pulses every stroke --- two notches to push
    piston down.&nbsp; It looks like maybe too much oil.&nbsp; If so, will
    shorten the piston a bit.&nbsp; The next test will be to see if it can push
    against the steam pressure.&nbsp; That must wait until the boiler arrives
    and inlet header is finished.&nbsp;&nbsp; Must also decide on a oil fill
    port.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will revise this note when those additions are made. </p>

            the pump output to the end of the engine input header.&nbsp;&nbsp; A
            union was put in the line near the header to facilitate lubricator
            removal.&nbsp;&nbsp;The photo at right shows the
            upper end of this tube.
            <p>A 1/8&quot; pipe nipple was silver soldered to the top to serve

            1/16&quot; hole drilled in the center.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Initial tests of the lubricator (using compressed air to
            power&nbsp; the engine)&nbsp; indicated way too much oil was being
            supplied.&nbsp; The piston stroke below the bottom of the
            feed holes was measured to be&nbsp; 0.25&quot;.&nbsp;
            The piston was shorted to reduce the stroke
            to about 0.1&quot;.&nbsp; After a test run on steam the piston
            was shortened again to make the stroke about 0.050&quot;.&nbsp; This
            cut the&nbsp; consumption to about 0.25 fl oz per hour.&nbsp; The ~2 fl oz tank should last all day. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Update 2/29/04:&nbsp; </b>Before painting the lubricator I
    thought I'd better try to figure out why it was putting out so much
    oil.&nbsp; (Initially when it was running it on compressed air, the oil
    coated the smokestack and was running down the outside.&nbsp; When shut off,
    the oil dripped down around the flange on the bottom of the
    smokestack.&nbsp;&nbsp; If powered by steam, the oil would have probably
    mixed with the steam and been dripping off the engineer.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially,&nbsp;
    the stroke was a little over 0.25&quot;. &nbsp; As pointed out above, the
    consumption is now in the ballpark after the stroke was cut to ~0.050&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The output was expected to be maybe twice the appropriate oil, but not 3 or
    4 times.&nbsp;&nbsp; How could it have been off so much?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The calculations were checked again and all seemed
    to be in order.&nbsp; Then it dawned on me ----- <b>Hiraoka's pump runs on
    an axel and I'm running the pump off the crankshaft ---- the crankshaft
    turns twice as fast as the axel hence twice as much oil!&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Hence,
    about 4 times the required oil.&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
    <p>Even with the stroke cut to ~0.050&quot;, it's still probably pumping a
    little too much.&nbsp; The stoke is so short that it can't be trimmed any
    more without running the risk of the no oil being pumped.&nbsp; So, I bit the bullet and changed the piston to 1/8&quot;
    by sawing off the old piston, drilling the stub in the follower and silver
    soldering in a 1/8&quot; diameter rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A plug was silver
    soldered in the cylinder bore and the plug was then drilled and reamed
    1/8&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole job took about an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    stroke below the input holes is now about1/8&quot;.&nbsp; This will probably
    pump a little more oil than before but will give plenty of room for
    adjustment if needed after a real test&nbsp; pulling a load on a
    track.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The 1/8&quot; filler pipe was too
        small --- the oil stuck to the side plugging the pipe making it

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The 1/8&quot; MTP union connecting

        disconnect.</font></p>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The check valve failed again allowing
        steam to back up into the lubricator.</font></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The input pipe was changed from 1/8&quot;
    pipe to 3/8&quot; pipe, which made it very easy to fill.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I did a bit of research on manufactured
    lubricators and found that <a href="http://www.locoparts.net/">Loco Parts</a>
    makes a lubricator check valve combined with a right angle fitting that
    connects to the steam chest.&nbsp; This fitting is 1/8&quot; NPT on the
    steam chest side and 1/8&quot; tube compression fitting on the input side.&nbsp;
    I also noticed that some of locomotives at MCC had an external check valve
    in addition to the one in the lubricator so others may have had the same
    check valve problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">One concern&nbsp; with using a&nbsp;
    1/8&quot; tube compression to 1/8&quot; NPT elbow at the stream header was
    that the 1/8&quot; pipe size would seem way out of scale on the little shay.&nbsp;
    I found a 1/8&quot; tube compression to 1/16&quot; NPT elbow at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mcmaster.com/">McMaster-Carr</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    --- part # 5053K57.&nbsp; This fitting is sold as &quot;quick assembly&quot;
    and comes with a combined compression nut and sleeve.&nbsp; The standard
    nuts and sleeves will also work with the elbow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that
    1/16&quot; NPT is the same thread as 5/16&quot; MTP ---- buy the 1/16&quot;
    NPT taps and dies,&nbsp; they are 20% the cost of the MTP taps and dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I decided to switch from steel balls to
    poppet type check valves using O-Rings to see if they sealed any better.&nbsp;
    The Buna N O-Rings were selected&nbsp; because they are compatible with oil.&nbsp;
    The 250 degree max temperature will be OK at the lubricator end but will be
    pushing it at the&nbsp; steam header end.&nbsp; If the O-Ring at that end
    fails I'll replace it with a Viton O-Ring.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">For the lubricator end, the&nbsp; #103
    O-Ring (3/32&quot; ID, 1/16&quot; cross section) was selected along with a
    5/8&quot; long 0.24&quot; OD,&nbsp; 0.026&quot;&nbsp; wire size stainless
    steel compression spring.&nbsp; Both McMaster-Carr&nbsp; and <a href="http://www.mscdirect.com">MSC&nbsp;</a>
    sell packages of&nbsp; 5 precision compression springs for less than $5.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The one used here is McMaster part number 9435K39 which they list on the
    website for $9.73.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the item is added to the shopping cart
    it shows up as $4 something.&nbsp; Recall that the lubricator was originally
    made with a 3/16&quot; bore and the bottom part with the check ball was
    drilled 5/16&quot; and tapped 3/8-24.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the upper part of
    the bore was sleeved&nbsp; and reduced to 1/8&quot; to reduce oil output.&nbsp;
    If the lubricator was originally designed for 1/8&quot; bore then the
    smaller poppet made for the steam header end would also be suitable for the
    lubricator end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The # 003 O-Ring (0.056&quot; actual ID,
    0.176&quot; actual OD) and a 1/2&quot; long 0.18&quot; OD, 0.018&quot; wire
    spring (McMaster # 9435K24) were selected for the steam header check valve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

              This photo shows the elbow with check valve screwed into the end
              of the steam header.&nbsp; The elbow was painted so it fits right
              in.&nbsp; The compression fitting on the 1/8&quot; tube is much
              easer to connect than the 1/8&quot; MTP union.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
