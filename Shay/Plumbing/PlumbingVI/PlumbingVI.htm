    <p align=left>When I started
    to think about the blowdown I realized that I'd never seen the actual valves
    on a Shay --- and none of my photos showed the valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; On a
    subsequent trip to Cass I found and photographed the valve on several different shays.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>As I understand normal operation, the valve is occasionally opened when the boiler is under
    pressure to expel debris that has collected in the mud ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    valve can also be used to drain the boiler.&nbsp; Some of the local folks
    attach a hose&nbsp; and use the hot water under pressure to hose down their
    locomotives after use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe the most important use is to initially
    fill the boiler&nbsp; ----&nbsp; just connect&nbsp; a garden hose to the
    discharge pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <P>The blowdown valve I decided to make is like one that Jim Buchanan (&nbsp;<a href="http://jambuch.home.insightbb.com/">Buchanan
    Machine Works</a>&nbsp;)<b> </b>uses on his Climax.&nbsp; &nbsp;Jim sent me
    a copy of the design from May/June 1997 Live
    Steam.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Jim later told me that he
    would not use this design again because scale eventually builds in the
    boiler and the scale then cuts the O Ring necessitating frequent
    replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp; He suggests a
    design with bronze body and stainless type wiper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b> </font>Since
    I already had the valve constructed I decided to try it and see if I had the
    same problem.<font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></P>

            pieces.&nbsp; The outer disks are turned from bronze --- left over
            from making crankshaft bearings.&nbsp; Brass or stainless would also
            work great. The middle disk&nbsp; is stainless
            steel.&nbsp; The next step was to drill and tap six 4-40 holes on a
            1.25&quot; bolt circle to hold the two bronze pieces together.&nbsp;
            The holes in the thinner piece were threaded.&nbsp;
            <p>Next, the three pieces were assembled and a 1/4&quot; hole
            drilled through all three pieces at a radius of
            0.302&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            machined from brass
            stock.&nbsp; The length is not critical.&nbsp;&nbsp; The inside is
            drilled 1/4&quot;&nbsp; The critical measurements are the 5/16&quot;
            diameter 0.55&quot; long stub.&nbsp; The sealing O-Ring (7/16&quot;
            OD - 5/16&quot; ID)&nbsp; rides on the stub.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The pipe was then silver soldered into the thinner bronze disk with
            the tip of the stub flush with the inside surface&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Note that the center disk is 0.142&quot; and the recess it rests in is
    0.156&quot; deep so there is a 0.014&quot; end float.&nbsp; The&nbsp; O-Ring recess is 0.055&quot; deep which
    with the 0.014&quot; end float gives
            a total height&nbsp; of 0.069&quot; for the O-Ring.&nbsp; The O-Ring nominal
    diameter is 0.070&quot; with a range of 0.067&quot; to 0.073&quot;.&nbsp;
    The width of the slot is 0.062&quot; so the O ring is squeezed a bit which should push
    it out a few thousands to&nbsp; give a good
    seal.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tested the valve at 125 psi air and no leaks.&nbsp;
    If it starts to leak I'll turn a few thousands off the thicker disk to
    reduce the depth of the recess for the rotating disk.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The author of the note in Live Steam (I didn't get the
    part with the author identified) suggests a Viton O-Ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; Viton
    has a high temperature rating but is not recommended for
    steam.&nbsp; I'm going to try the NSF-Approved Ethylene
    Propylene (EPDM) that is rated up to 300 degrees --- with 100 psi steam I'll
    be
    stretching&nbsp; it a few degrees, but I figure it should be OK.</p>
    <p>The next photo shows the finished parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The input pipe was
    silver soldered to the disk on the right which cause the darker
    color.&nbsp; &nbsp; The end of the operating
    handle will be cut to length and drilled after the valve is mounted and the best position of
    the release handle determined.</p>

            by a nipple, elbow and long tube that will pass through a hole in

    <p align="left"><b>Update (12/07/03):&nbsp;</b> The blowdown valve was
    installed in the back of the boiler as shown in the next photo.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A short piece of
    5/16&quot; stainless drilled to 15/64&quot; was silver soldered between the
    blowdown and the elbow in the discharge path.&nbsp; This was after a
    5/16&quot; MTP brass nipple broke.&nbsp;&nbsp; This stainless tube has an ID
    very close to 1/8&quot; pipe so there will not be much flow
    restriction.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 3/8&quot; OD soft copper tube threaded 1/8&quot; NPT on each
    end is used for the discharge pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The soft tube together with a bracket under the frame to support the tube
    and the use of a stainless tube between the elbow and valve should prevent
    the 5/16&quot; tube breaking in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp; <img border="0" src="Update1.JPG" width="709" height="333"></p>
    <p>While taking apart the valve to do the above modifications I noticed a
    cut in the O-Ring just like Jim Buchanan predicted.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
    that was before it was connected to to the boiler, it had just be tested
    with compressed air.&nbsp; I removed the O-Ring for closer inspection and
    found it cut all the way through ----- then I remembered not having the
    correct size O-Ring and cutting down a larger diameter one.&nbsp; Best order
    the correct size.&nbsp;</p>

          <td rowspan="2"><b>Update (12/10/03):&nbsp; </b>Yep, here's another update.&nbsp;
            Shortly after I did the update above Dan Staron suggested that it
            would have been better to use a tee rather&nbsp;than an elbow in
            the discharge.&nbsp; The straight end of the tee could be closed
            with a plug but opened if the blowdown became plugged and a rod run
            though to unplug it.&nbsp; Good ideal!.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd also
            decided to hook up the operating link.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been
            postponing the link figuring that I could reach underneath and open
            the valve with my hand.&nbsp; However, then realized that there are
            no seals in the output side of the valve and it will likely leak
            ---- don't want boiling water over my hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also,
            had obtained the correct O-Ring&nbsp; so went back at it.&nbsp;
            <p>The photo on right above shows the tee ----- or more accurately, a
            1/4&quot; MTP cleanout plug in the elbow.&nbsp;
            <p>&nbsp;The operating link is
            1/8&quot; stainless with a cotter pin in the bottom.&nbsp; The top
            of the link is threaded 5-40 and doesn't quite reach the underside
            of the cab floor
            when the lever is pushed all the way down (valve
            closed).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The handle shown on the right is a loop of 3/32&quot; stainless
            rod silver soldered&nbsp; to a length of 3/16&quot; brass
            rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom of the rod is tapped 5-40 and
            screws over the link.&nbsp; The handle can be unscrewed when it
            is necessary to remove the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    <p>I'll update this again after some experience with scale ----- not long
    now.&nbsp;&nbsp; LocoParts has reduced the price of their blowdown valve ---
    probably a good alternative to changing O-Rings.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Update 6/6/04: </b>The valve had been in use for a number of steaming
    hours and no problem yet with the O-Ring.&nbsp; I also noted that Bob Reedy
    used this type of blowdown on his Three Truck Climax (<u>Live Steam</u>
    May/June 2004).&nbsp; The drawing is such that I'm pretty sure he's the
    author of the original design I got from Jim Buchanan</p>

          <td width="50%"><b>Update 2/10/06: </b>The shay is in the workshop for 
          annual maintenance and a few improvements.&nbsp; I had the cab floor 
          off so thought it was a good idea to open the blowdown valve and check 
          the condition of the O-Ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo on right shows the 
          inside of the valve.&nbsp; Everything has a rusty discoloration but 
          the surfaces are smooth and there is no scale.&nbsp; (Maybe the 
          LSB-8000 is keeping the scale away.)&nbsp; The O-ring was removed and 
          found to be undamaged after two years service.&nbsp; However, I have 
          some Viton O-Rings of the correct size (#011) so will replace the 
          O-Ring.&nbsp; Unlike EPDM, Viton is compatible with oil so I'll 
          lubricate the valve with steam oil before reassembling it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
