    <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">The axel pump is the primary
      source of feed water to the boiler when the locomotive is moving.&nbsp; It
      is mounted on the middle truck and driven by an eccentric on the rear axel
      of that truck.&nbsp; The eccentric was&nbsp; installed on the
      axel when the axel was fabricated months ago.&nbsp; The pump itself and
      the rod connecting the eccentric to the mump must be fabricated to
      complete the axel pump system.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;following Kenneth's
    design for the axel pump.</font></p>

              on the locomotive, the end of the rod secured with a piece of wire
              and the engine driven with compressed air to allow the
              rod/eccentric to smooth out any rough spots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>This piece went very quickly -- only a couple hours (better
              than cutting the grass on a hot afternoon).&nbsp;

              required.&nbsp;</td>

    <p align=left><b>Tolerances:&nbsp; </b>The tolerances were checked before
    staring on the pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cylinder bore is 1.12&quot; long.&nbsp;
    The eccentric throw is 5/8&quot; so the piston stroke is also
    5/8&quot;.&nbsp; The piston height is 3/8&quot; so the piston height plus
    stoke is 1.0&quot;&nbsp; This means there is a total margin of
    0.12&quot;.&nbsp; I don't think the position of the axel were the eccentric
    is mounted and the position of the lower spring plank where pump mounts were controlled that well.&nbsp; Besides, these dimensions can change
    as the truck flexes and parts move when the springs compress and
    expand.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to modify&nbsp; the design by making the cylinder
    1/8&quot; longer. Since the water is essentially non compressible, the pump operation
    won't be affected by the longer cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the stem on the
    piston was made extra long.&nbsp; The end of the stem will be finished to
    the required length measured after the pump has been mounted in the spring
    plank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              pieces shown here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing unusual except&nbsp; 1/2&quot; square stock rather than 5/8&quot; round stock
              was used for the
              plug ---- figured it would be easier to mark off the location of
              the four screw holes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> Even though clearances of 0.002&nbsp; were provided between
              the piston and cylinder,&nbsp; the&nbsp;fit was pretty tight. &nbsp;&nbsp;
              To smooth it out, the bore was lubricated, the piston
              inserted,&nbsp; the small end of the piston chucked in the lathe,
              and the cylinder grasped with the hand and slid back and forth as the piston
    rotated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Worked out the rough spots in a few minutes.&nbsp; Now
    is very smooth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              milling head can be tilted.&nbsp; First thought was to leave the
              mill straight and shim the one side the wedge up 5 degrees by
              slipping the correct size drill under one side.&nbsp; However, the
              calculator and computer were both upstairs and I wasn't about to
              try to compute the shim height using an old slide rule.&nbsp;</td>

              I

            <td>The next step was to silver solder the wedge to the pump
              body.&nbsp; It was decided to drill the hole in the spring plank first
              and test fit everything before doing the
              soldering.&nbsp;&nbsp; The drill press feature of the mill was
              used to drill the hole at 5 degrees.&nbsp; However, before drilling
              the hole, the surface was faced with an end mill to get a surface
              perpendicular to the drill so it wouldn't wander when
              starting.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the hole was drilled the
              pump was assembled in the hole and everything fit fine.&nbsp; The
              wedge was then silver soldered to the pump body.&nbsp; The pump
              body and wedge were then used as a pattern to drill and tap the
              holes that hold the pump to the spring plank.
              <p>The final task was to inset the piston and determine where to
              put the the hole to connect the rod.&nbsp;&nbsp; The longer
              cylinder gave a little more margin so a point midway
              between the possible extremes was picked for the hole.&nbsp; Turns out it was within a few
              thousands of the point Ken specified on the drawing ---- right on!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    <p align=left><b>Finished Pump: </b>The next photo shows the finished pump
    mounted on the truck.&nbsp; The top spring plank is&nbsp; off giving a better
    view of the pump.&nbsp; The only thing remaining is to connect 1/4&quot; ID hoses to the nipples on the side of the
    pump --- and of course, reassemble the truck.&nbsp; <CENTER><img border="0" src="MountedPump.jpg" width="696" height="418"></p>
    </CENTER>
     
    <p align=left>A neat thing about the pump that was suspected and now
    confirmed is that the pump can be removed without disassembling the
    truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintenance on the check valves can be performed merely
    by removing the screws holding the valve body and then lifting the valve
    body off.&nbsp;&nbsp; The piston will slide out after the valve body&nbsp;
    and pin to connecting the piston to the rod have been removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The body will also slide out if the valve body and pin between the rod and
    piston have been removed.&nbsp; A neat design!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <td><b>Update - Test: </b>The pump was tested before finishing the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The locomotive was run on the test stand with the engine powered by
        compressed air.&nbsp; The first test was at low pressure with the output
        hose emptying back into the tender tank.&nbsp; Next, the steam pressure
        gauge was connected to the output and the engine turned by hand.&nbsp;
        The hose connections leaked some that limited the
        pressure. Was able to run the engine at very low speed and run a
        pressure of well over 100 psi.&nbsp; The pump should work fine.&nbsp;
        Some work is needed on the hose connections.&nbsp; Also, need stronger
        hose --- the hose used for the test got much fatter as the pressure
        increased.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
