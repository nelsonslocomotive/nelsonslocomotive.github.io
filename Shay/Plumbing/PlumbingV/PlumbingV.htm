    <p align=left>There are no Live Steam suppliers in the local area (central
    Ohio)&nbsp; where one can go and examine various products.&nbsp; There are
    several Live Steamers in the area and they have been more than willing to
    explain the choices they made in selecting various components.&nbsp; The
    data these guys provided has been very useful.&nbsp; I've found the
    plumbing fittings particularly fascinating, more so after I was able to
    examine the variations in detail.&nbsp; The purpose of this note is to share
    with others photos of some of the fittings because there seems to be no
    other source of comparison data.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>A general plumbing plan was developed several months ago (<a href="../PlumbingI/PlumbingI.htm">Plumbing I
    </a>).&nbsp;Next, each
    plumbing run was sketched and all the required fittings itemized.&nbsp; The
    fittings were then ordered ----&nbsp; several months before they were
    required in case some were temporarily out of stock ----&nbsp; which
    indeed turned out to be the case.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>The&nbsp; fittings are from LS Manufacturing, Coles and
    Superscale .&nbsp; There are differences in the fittings supplied by each
    which is why the multiple sources were selected.&nbsp; During this process I
    had a conversation with John at LS Manufacturing and several conversations
    with a gentleman at Coles (I failed to write down his name --- my
    fault).&nbsp; Both LS Manufacturing and Coles expressed a genuine interest
    in satisfying my needs and I plan to deal with both in the
    future.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll make references to these conversations&nbsp; as I
    discuss the specific fittings.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the initial purchase from
    Coles, LS Manufacturing and Superscale I became aware of the PM
    Research&nbsp; line of fittings and bought a a few for a comparison--- and
    to cover those fittings that were out of stock at Coles.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>I had no direct communication with anyone at SuperScale.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    However, they shipped my order quickly and all fittings were as described in
    their catalog.&nbsp; The SuperScale prices are a bit higher than the other
    two suppliers and they charge both a shipping and a handling fee that comes to $22.25 minimum per order.&nbsp;&nbsp; That seems a
    bit steep ---- but I was willing to pay it because I wanted some things that
    only they supply.&nbsp; Hope the fitting count was accurate ---don't want pay the fees
    on a second order&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            the blower and water feed pipes running parallel down the side of
            the boiler I decided to make the blower line 3/16&quot;.&nbsp; After

            1/4&quot; fittings while Coles supplies TrueScale fittings in

            tees from SuperScale however,&nbsp; the check valve I bought (see
            later photo) suggests that the SuperScale fittings are similar to
            the&nbsp; castings from LS Manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Manufacturing (on right in photo) are from hex stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            SuperScale makes unions with two female ends like those shown on
            right and also unions with one male and one female end like shown in
            the first photo.&nbsp; In some applications the male- female type
            will eliminate the need for a short nipple ---- very handy and economical.&nbsp;</td>

            valve I was surprised to find that the male end is
            5/16&quot; MTP&nbsp; since the valve is 1/4&quot; and the
            female side is threaded 1/4&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; I dropped an email
            to Jim at LS Manufacturing and suggested that the description on the
            webpage be modified to include the male thread size.&nbsp;&nbsp; A
            few hours later Jim gave me a call and apologized for the
            description omission.&nbsp; I had already concluded that there was
            insufficient material to turn the male part down and thread
            1/4&quot;.&nbsp; I had also concluded that I could easily cut off
            the male end and thread the valve body female 1/4&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Jim confirmed both these points and said they had just made a run of
            these valves with the male part replaced with 1/4&quot; female
            ends.&nbsp; Apparently it's difficult to make a 1/4&quot; male part
            on these valves without restricting the full open flow rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    <p align=left>The following photos show&nbsp; the water feed on Cass No 5 on

    right.&nbsp; The street elbow and short nipples are from Coles, globe valve
    and union are from LS Manufacturing and the check valve is from SuperScale.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    None of the fittings have been tightened --- once that is done the setup on
    the right should be nearly identical to the Cass No 5 water feed.&nbsp; The only remaining difference is the Valve
    handle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Live Steam Models Ltd (UK) carries several
    sizes of lost wax casting 5 spoke hand wheels very similar to the handles on Cass
    No 5.&nbsp; Live Steam Models lists a number of other interesting sounding
    parts, but there are no photos so a visit to get a hands-on view would be very
    helpful ----- and I have scads of frequent flyer miles.&nbsp; Hmmmm, wonder

          <td><b>Water Gauge: </b>The initial plan was to fabricate the water
            gauge.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the design of the Coles <i>water gauge
            for large boilers </i>was appealing, especially the lower cutoff
            valve design that permits mounting directly to the boiler saving
            both space and a stack of fittings.&nbsp; The compact drain cock on
            the bottom is also handy.&nbsp;&nbsp; One concern was whether it
            would be the correct height but it appeared that the height could be
            adjusted if necessary.&nbsp; The nipple in the top part of
            the gauge is not part of the gauge unit --- it was inserted to show
            the position of the top port.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <p>After the gauge arrived the visible part of the glass was found
            to be&nbsp; 2.625&quot;&nbsp; --- about right since the space
            between the top of the crown sheet and the inside top of the boiler
            is a little over 3.5&quot; (this is from drawings, will measure actual
            boiler when it arrives in a few weeks and correct this if
            necessary.)&nbsp; The distance between the centerlines of the top and
            bottom ports is about 3.6&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The male fitting on the bottom is 1/8&quot; NPT that can be
            screwed into a mating hole in the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; The female
            port on the top piece is threaded 1/4&quot; 32 TPI.&nbsp; The
            threads are not specified for the drain cock port on the
            bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The four side rods are 1/8&quot; brass with the ends turned down
            slightly and threaded 4-40 so it would be easy to cut down the rods
            or fabricate longer rods if necessary.&nbsp; Replacement 1/2&quot;
            OD glass is available from both Coles and McMaster-Carr.&nbsp; O-rings
            are used to seal between the ends of the glass and the brass pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    </div>
    <p align=left>One of the concerns I had is that the top port is threaded
    1/4&quot; 32 TPI and not tapered.&nbsp; Further, I don't have a 1/4&quot;-32 die
    to make a mating fitting and didn't want to buy a die.&nbsp;&nbsp; One
    solution is to drill out the hole to 1/4&quot; and solder in a piece of
    1/4&quot; tube and then thread the end of the tube 1/4&quot;
    MTP.&nbsp;&nbsp; After looking at the top port I decided to just rethread it
    1/4&quot; MTP.&nbsp; If it doesn't seal, I'll solder it with 550 degree soft
    solder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>When the gauge arrived the little drain cock was
    missing.&nbsp; The water gauge had been on back order and I surmised that
    the&nbsp; gauges were supplied without the cocks and Coles added the cocks since they
    carry the cock (<i>straight nose cock</i>) as a separate item.&nbsp; I
    called Coles and that was exactly the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; They said they'd
    ship the missing cock immediately.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>A couple hours later Coles called and said there
    was a problem ---- the port in the bottom of the water gauge is threaded
    10-32 and the cock is threaded 3/16-40.&nbsp; The guy said that he assumed
    the manufacturer of the gauge had used the wrong thread but indeed the
    drawing said 10-32.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I assume the drawing will be changed to
    3/16&quot;- 40.)&nbsp;&nbsp; I though about it a minute decided that since
    the #10 thread is 3/16&quot; diameter I could rethread the cock 10-32.&nbsp;
    The 32 TPI thread is deeper than the 40 TPI so&nbsp; strength shouldn't be
    a problem.&nbsp; Since the threads are straight rather then tapered an aluminum
    or Teflon sealing washer is required in either case.&nbsp; (The Teflon
    washer didn't work very well --- it just squeezed out when tightened .&nbsp;
    A thin aluminum washer worked great.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>Note that both LS Manufacturing and Coles gave quick response
    to questions and were able to satisfy my needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not hesitate
    to deal with both in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I was very satisfied with
    the unions and check valves I obtained from SuperScale.</p>
    <p align=left>Some of the problems encountered involved the various thread
    standards. It could have been much worse if metric standards were added to
    the mix. On the other hand we should count our blessings that we don't have
    to deal with units such as furlongs and stones.</p>
    <p align=left>I'm an Electrical Engineer --- an area that had used the
    metric standard from WWII or before.&nbsp; It's a shame that the US didn't
    officially follow through with the plan to convert to metric in the
    60s.&nbsp; The conversion has in fact taken place in many areas such as the
    auto industry.&nbsp; (The auto industry still has a problem with which side
    to mount the steering wheel).&nbsp; The major holdup was probably some
    powerful old folks who didn't want to have to deal with a new
    system.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>I've observed one nonscientific not-so-young woman who has
    been able to cope when necessary with metric units when traveling
    outside the US.&nbsp; For example she has a simple approximation (double and
    add 30) to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit to determine whether she is hot or
    cold.&nbsp; The national conversion to metric would have happened overnight if the
    advocates had explained
    that a 150 pound person would weigh only 68 after the
    conversion.</p>
