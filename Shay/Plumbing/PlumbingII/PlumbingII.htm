      <p align=left>The hand
      pump located in the tender water tank is a backup pump should the axel
      pump fail or if the locomotive has been under steam but not moving.&nbsp; &nbsp;
      The hand pump was built first so that the tender tank could be
      finished.&nbsp; Kenneth's design was followed except&nbsp; for the cylinder;
      a 1&quot; diameter rod was bored to exactly 3/4&quot; so
      that&nbsp; could use standard 3/4&quot; OD 9/16&quot; ID O-Rings could be
      used.&nbsp; Kenneth suggests a 3/4&quot; brass pipe nipple.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align=left>The lathe work was done first.&nbsp; The next photo shows
      the collection of parts after the lathe work.</p>

            plate to match the square piece.&nbsp; This was done so that
            everything would stay aligned when the two pieces were soldered
            together.</td>

            heated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            up on cleaning them perfectly.&nbsp; The photo shows the nice silver
            solder fillet at the joint.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <p>After the soldering the 1/16&quot; hole was drilled in the side
            of the square part for the pin to retain the lower ball in
            position.&nbsp; The 7/32 hole was also drilled through from the
            rectangular part&nbsp; into the square part.&nbsp; A 17/64&quot;
            reamer was run down the square part&nbsp; to remove any burrs
            after these&nbsp; holes were drilled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            convert to 1/4&quot; tubing at the output and to use compression
            fittings for the tubing.&nbsp; A 1/8&quot; NPT to 1/4&quot;
            tubing compression fitting elbow was used on one output and a tee with
            1/8&quot; NPT on the side and 1/4&quot; compression fittings on the
            ends for the other output.&nbsp; Inspection of the 1/8&quot; NPT
            ends revealed that the 5/16&quot; ball on the pump output would
            probably press into the pipe fitting and seal the output.&nbsp; This was remedied by filing a slot in the ends of the fittings as
            shown on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            After the solder flowed the triangle piece was tapped with a hammer
            to make sure it was seated in the slot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The slot makes a neat way to keep the two

            joint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <p align=left>The next step was to drill a hole through the lower handle
    with a matching hole in the triangle part of the cylinder for the
    pivot.&nbsp;&nbsp; A second set of holes were drilled through the lower part
    of the bars that match up with a slot in the piston.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two clevis
    pins were then made from stainless steel and everything was
    assembled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The completed pump is shown below.</p>
