      <p align="left">It's been over a year since the Shay was started.&nbsp;
      It's been under steam on the test stand so it's had hot water and hot
      oil scattered over the surface.&nbsp; Some pieces now have surface rust
      while other parts have enough oil on them to keep away rust for a
      hundred years.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's too cold to run it so I decided to
      start the painting.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tender is essentially finished so it
      could be completely painted. &nbsp; The locomotive is also essentially
      complete except for the smoke box rivets, boiler jacket and domes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
      decided to paint the tender first and then do the trucks and the main
      frame.&nbsp; If the weather is still bad at that point I'll probably try
      to finish the boiler and get it installed permanently.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      various pieces of plumbing and pipes will be next and the cab and engine
      last since they can be removed without disassembling the rest of the
      locomotive.</p>
      <p align="left">The initial plan was to powder coat (PC) the smaller parts such
      as trucks and engine and spray the larger pieces with automotive type
      epoxy paint.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after PCing most of the tender parts and
      remembering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The mess of spraying</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The cost of paint (~$200 for a quart of primer and a
          quart of color and hardeners and reducers for each)</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The smell</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The need to heat the garage</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The mess of mixing the paint again and again to do a
          small group of parts</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The spouse's complaints about smell &amp; mess.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I decided to PC the whole thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest problem with
      PCing larger pieces is to get an oven large enough to accept&nbsp; pieces
      such as the 49&quot; long main frame.&nbsp; However, I think I can
      overcome that problem so, current plan is to PC everything.</p>
      <p>I had already PCed the tender truck, frame, floor and tank top before I
      thought to take any pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I can describe painting
      similar parts of the main locomotive so nothing is lost.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      main thing I want to pass on with these notes is the degree of disassembly
      I used.&nbsp; Some disassembly is required to do an adequate job of rust
      prevention.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; one would be at it for a year if
      everything is disassembled.&nbsp; Also, some parts won't fit together if
      completely painted because of the paint thickness.&nbsp; The disassembly
      is applicable to both liquid and powder paint.&nbsp;</p>

              decided to start this with the&nbsp; painting of those parts.&nbsp; The photo
              shows sill parts hanging from an oven rack.&nbsp;&nbsp; The parts
              were cooling after the powder coating was heated for curing.&nbsp;
              Sorry I didn't put something light colored behind the parts so
              they showed up better.&nbsp;</td>

            <td>This photo shows the finished sill.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wood was painted
              with RUST-OLEUM Satin black that had been diluted to about half strength
              with thinner so that the paint would soak in but not completely
              obscure the wood grain.&nbsp; Two coats were
              used.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't decided whether to paint the
              stainless steel screw heads. If I do, I'll use a small brush and RUST-OLEUM&nbsp;
              Gloss Black.&nbsp;&nbsp; This paint can also be used to repair any
              minor defect with the powder coating.&nbsp; That's the fuel tank
              in the background.
              <p>The screws through the sill are 1.5&quot; long hex head
              stainless steel 4-40.&nbsp;&nbsp; I normally purchase hex head
              screws from McMaster Carr.&nbsp; However, they don't carry 4-40
              hex head screws 1.5&quot; long.&nbsp; I purchased the longer
              screws as well as some #0 &amp; #2 hex head screws from <a href="http://www.microfasteners.com/">Microfasteners</a>.&nbsp;
              They gave quick delivery at a good price.</p>

              sprayed on the tank but before the curing.&nbsp; Before spraying, the tank was taken outside and
              blasted to remove all oil and surface rust.&nbsp; Next, it was
              heated in the oven to drive out all liquids that had accumulated in
              the seams and around the rivets.&nbsp; After the heating there
              were faint oil stains around a number of rivets. If the oil had
              come out during the curing process, the paint gloss would be ruined
              in those areas.&nbsp; After the heating the tank was blasted
              again.&nbsp; The powder was then applied in the vented paint
              booth.&nbsp; If it was warmer I'd have done it
              outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              after the powder flows back the temperature off to
              about 400 degrees for 5 minutes for small objects and 10 or 15
              minutes for heavy objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used 355 degree soft
              solder on the tank so had to keep the temperature below about 325
              degrees.&nbsp; I did some tests using small pieces soldered together
              and also watched the oven temperature.&nbsp; I found that a
              setting of 275 degrees had transients up to about 325
              degrees.&nbsp; A setting of 300 degrees went above the 350 degrees
              and the test pieces fell apart.&nbsp;&nbsp; I heated the tank at
              setting of 275 for
              about 20 minutes after first cycle of the thermostat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Next time I'll use higher temperature solder.</p>

              scraped off the galvanize.)&nbsp; I used KWIK-SET 3 - 3 HOUR SUB
              SEA/MARINE EPOXY (McMaster-Carr).&nbsp;&nbsp; It turned out to be the
              consistency of bread dough.&nbsp; I thinned it a little and
              applied it with a brush.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did the bottom and
              sides first and the next day did the underside of the top and
              touched up the sides and bottom,&nbsp; The stuff is pretty thick
              --- like a coat of stucco.&nbsp; The paint has embedded Kevlar
              fibers so it should be able to handle really hard water rattling
              around in the tank.&nbsp;</td>
