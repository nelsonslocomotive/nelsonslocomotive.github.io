      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The engine was the last thing
      to be painted before the Shay was operational again.&nbsp; I was undecided at first
        whether to use powder coat or black oxide on the engine.&nbsp; The black
        oxide is nice because it doesn't build on the surface and interfere with
        operation.&nbsp; The oxide coating has a flat finish but is shinny when
        covered with oil which will likely be the case on the engine.&nbsp; When
        disassembling the engine I found several areas with rust ---- in spite
        of the oil.&nbsp;&nbsp; The steam environment is harsh on the rust prone
        castings.&nbsp; So, decided to do the powder coat.</font></p>
        <p align="left">The following engine parts were powder coated:</p>

              disassemble each cylinder to remove the piston rod, cross head and
              valve stem, then to temporarily reassemble the units.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The inside surfaces of the cross head guide as well as the head
              and steam chest cover were all masked.&nbsp; The bottom of the
              crosshead guide and the machined surfaces of the valve stem guide
              were also masked.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo shows one cylinder about to
              be sprayed (powdered).&nbsp;&nbsp; That's part of one of the slip
              joints in the background that was being sprayed at the same
              time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      Also, a way to hold the locomotive in my small SUV must
      be devised.&nbsp; After that must wait for decent weather for a trip to the track
      (there's several inches of snow on the ground and more
      coming).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cab window frames are next on the list to
      finish off the cab so that it can be
      painted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
