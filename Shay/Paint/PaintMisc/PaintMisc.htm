        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">This page shows how some of
        the pile of smaller parts were painted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">One of the first small parts
        tackled was the reversing gear.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reversing gear does
        triple duty in that it supports one end of the shelf over the rear
        cylinder and also the atomizer regulator.&nbsp; The&nbsp; reversing gear
        bracket also supports the air input plumbing and the&nbsp; air/steam
        manifold that supplies the atomizer and blower.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, it
        was important to get the reversing gear in place as soon as the boiler
        was painted and bolted down.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The reversing gear and also
      the throttle don't lend themselves to painting or powder coating
        since the paint would clog up the teeth of the racks and the sliding
        latches.&nbsp; Bluing and the black oxide
        on some machine screws were considered.&nbsp; An Internet search lead to several
        suppliers of small kits to do black oxide finish on mild steel at room
        temperature.&nbsp; The chemicals won't work on tool steel or stainless
        or non ferrous metals.&nbsp; A black oxide </font>kit was purchased from <a href="http://www.caswellplating.com" target="_blank">Caswell
              Plating</a>.&nbsp;<font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

              pints of distilled water (purchased locally) in the plastic

              about 15 minutes, washed off, blown dry and then bead
              blasted.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wires were given the same treatment so as

              as a wetting agent.) The solution works at 70
              degrees but does a little better at 80 degrees so it was warmed a
              bit and&nbsp; the parts immersed for about 7 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>After the parts were removed, they were rinsed in cold water,
              shook dry and then placed in the&nbsp; penetrating sealer for
              about 10 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of the handles stuck out of the
              cans so sealer was brushed on those parts every couple
              minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              the remaining parts were plumbing related.&nbsp; The powder coat
              works quite well on the brass and copper.&nbsp;&nbsp; The parts
              were pickled about 10 minutes in the warm sulfuric acid solution
              normally used for steel.&nbsp; That removed most the
              grease.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pieces were then bead blasted.&nbsp; The
              photo shows a group of pipes just after the powder coat was
              cured.&nbsp; Tees were
              screwed on the ends of the pipes and hanging wires
              then threaded through the tees and then the tees were masked.&nbsp;
              The masking tape was
              removed while the parts were still very hot.&nbsp; The same
              cleaning process could be used if spray
              painting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              and less noticeable while leaving the valve stems and wheels unpainted
              makes them stand out and adds a bit of color.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              valve stems were removed during the pickling and blasting but
              screwed in place and masked off for&nbsp; the painting.&nbsp; The threads
              between the stem and valve body are very fine and you don't want
              to get paint on them (Mr. Experience speaking here).&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The unions also have have very fine threads and were joined before

              plumbing reassembly.&nbsp; It helps to use a correct size wrench
              (12 mm for the 1/4&quot; unions).</td>

              &nbsp; The tee is configured

              mount.&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be a plug in the lower opening on
              the tee.
