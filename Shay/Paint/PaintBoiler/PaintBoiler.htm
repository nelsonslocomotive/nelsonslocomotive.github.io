              quick final blast and then set it in the backhead and spray on the
              powder.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did this in front of the over and then swept
              up any that fell to the floor.&nbsp; I also turned off the furnace and
              house ventilation to keep the stuff out of that
              system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't need to explain black dust all over the house.</td>

              upright,&nbsp; it was turned to the normal horizontal position

              sprayed on the back part of the boiler and the
              backhead.&nbsp;&nbsp; This photo shows the boiler after some more
              powder was sprayed. and the boiler slid part way into the oven. &nbsp; Note the thin areas on the rear side of
              the jacket spacers.&nbsp; More powder was sprayed so that everything
              was covered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>That is a&nbsp; handle in the
              front screwed on a threaded rod that is secured to a plate in the smoke box.&nbsp;
              The plate is held to the top of the smoke box with a couple screws
              through the smoke stack mounting holes.&nbsp; The threaded rod extends
              through the bottom of the smoke box&nbsp; to form a leg for the
              front.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rear handle is a couple
              nipples&nbsp; and an elbow&nbsp; screwed into the steam turret hole.</td>

              handy.
              <p>The baking took a couple hours since the boiler has
              considerable mass.&nbsp;&nbsp; The smoke box part flowed fairly quickly but
              the&nbsp; backhead took over an hour to flow as it was the
              furthest from
              the burner.</td>

              jacket was also very smooth but had areas with no
              gloss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some experimentation on another
              piece it was concluded that the front area was over heated
              (burned).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>&nbsp;After a day of reflection, the smoke box was stripped (
              stripping the powder coat is no fun), blasted to get a good clean
              surface and it was then recoated.&nbsp; This time care was taken to
              keep the maximum temperature swing to below 400 degrees and the
              boiler was kept in the oven for only 20
              minutes after the powder had flowed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The results this
              time was very nice--- glad I took the effort to redo
              it..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              cheap Wal-Mart stripper.&nbsp; The pieces were lightly blasted to
              remove any residue and to roughen the surface a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p align="left"><b>Lagging: </b>The lagging used on the full size
        boilers is a hard material.&nbsp; I assume it contained asbestos in the
        early days . Suspect the current versions don't.&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a
        freshly lagged boiler at Cass 20+ years ago. As I recall the lagging came in blocks about the size of bricks and
        was held in place by a
        plaster like material.&nbsp;&nbsp; I checked what McMaster-Carr and
        found a 1/4&quot; alumina-silica fiber insulation (93315K61) that looked
        like it would work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">The day before I was set to apply the insulation
        Dan Staron called to talk about progress on our shays.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        When I mentioned&nbsp; boiler lagging he suggested that I consult <a href="http://www.whitetrout.net/Chuck/" target="_blank">Chuck
        Hackett's</a> webpage.&nbsp; Chuck had&nbsp; run some tests on boiler
        insulation and concluded that lagging is no better than&nbsp; trapped
        air under a jacket.&nbsp; The lagging is however useful in preventing
        dents in the jacket.&nbsp; And here I was getting ready to install insulation that has little if any insulating
        value and is so soft it
        won't prevent dents.</p>
        <p align="left">I had asked Ed Perry for lagging advice some time back
        and he said that he had used cork sheets on a couple
        boilers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The McMaster-Carr site suggests cork is good
        for gaskets up to about 180 degrees F.&nbsp; Another section says cork
        insulation is good up to 266 degrees F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The maximum
        temperature inside the boiler will be about 340 degrees F (100 psi
        steam).&nbsp; There should be a gradient as one gets closer to the
        outside so that a guess is that&nbsp; the maximum temperature of the
        insulation will be about 300 degrees F.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
        a little above the max operating temperature temperature I'd found for
        cork,&nbsp; but should be in the operating margins (if the speed limit
        is 70, you can usually get by at 75).&nbsp;</p>

              <td><b>Cork Test:</b>&nbsp; I had been thinking&nbsp; about the lagging
                while preparing the smoke box area to be powder coated again.&nbsp;
                A piece of cork sheet was laid across the boiler while the smoke
                box area powder was cured.&nbsp; The temperature at the very&nbsp;
                back got to 300 degrees and the temperature at the front got to
                375 degrees, so the cork probably made it to about 340
                degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no noticeable effect on the
                cork.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <p>The cork offers some insulation valve and a fairly firm base
                for the jacket so I decided to use the cork.&nbsp; I had a few
                sheets of varying thicknesses on hand and a quarter inch
                thickness will easily achieved using multiple layers.&nbsp;Maybe
                can sell that other stuff to the brother-in-law.&nbsp;</td>
