      <p>Painting of the locomotive trucks and frame are described in this
      page.&nbsp; The tender truck and frame were painted using the
      same process.&nbsp; The tender frame is much smaller so less effort was
      required to fit it in the oven for curing. &nbsp;&nbsp; The current plan is to powder coat the entire
      locomotive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photos show some of the techniques I used to do
      the powder coating.&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar process can be used if one is
      spray painting everything --- except one has to wait for the paint to dry
      before reassembling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              the rear truck so it seemed best to pull the cab, cab floor and

              degreaser, washed in hot soapy water and then cleaned in the
              pickling solution.&nbsp; The photo shows most the truck parts (
              less the axels) in the crock pot.&nbsp; There were left in the
              solution about a half hour on each end and then washed off.&nbsp;
              <p>The pickling solution seem to be loosing strength so I dumped
              it and made a fresh pot using a can of Sparex No 1.&nbsp; Wow, what a
              difference;&nbsp; the old pot must have got down to 25% of
              original strength.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I found <a href="http://www.thompsonenamel.com/" target="_blank">Thompson
              Enamel</a> carries cans of both Sparex No1 and Sparex No 2 for
              $4.99 a can.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the change, most pieces are
              cleaned in a hot solution in about 10 minutes.</p>

      <p><b>Axel Pump:&nbsp; </b>I did a test firing a couple weeks before this
      painting project.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark Mihalyi had come from near Pittsburgh
      to assist.&nbsp; It was about 15 degrees outside which probably says something
      about our mental capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After steam was up the
      locomotive ran on the test stand for about a half hour.&nbsp; The throttle
      was then closed to allow steam pressure to build so that the whistle could
      be adjusted.&nbsp; (The whistle didn't sound very good ---- problem was
      that it was so cold that the steam condensed and the whistle merely
      spit.&nbsp; After it got hot, it sounded better.&nbsp; Hope it works OK in
      warm weather.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The throttle was opened again after the whistle
      test (about ten minutes later) but the wheels turned very hard and there
      was a screeching sound.&nbsp; First thought was that the brakes had hung
      up.&nbsp; Brakes were checked and found to be OK.&nbsp; It sounded like a
      bearing someplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We decided to turn off the fire,
      drain the boiler, wheel it inside and go to lunch.&nbsp; After we warmed
      up a bit&nbsp; we played with the line shafts and found that the noise was
      coming from the axel pump.&nbsp; I was thinking about that pump on the way
      to lunch and it finally dawned on me that water freezes at 32 degrees
      ------ and it was 15 degrees.&nbsp; The pump had been idle for about 10 minutes and the pipes
      and tender had been in the cold for over an hour.&nbsp; Maybe the pump
      output pipe froze up. That would certainly make the pump
      stiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; After I returned from lunch (about four hours later
      ---- there was much to discuss at lunch)&nbsp; the pump turned freely and
      made no noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I was anxious to examine the pump to see if the screeching was due
      to metal on metal rubbing and determine any damage.&nbsp; There were some
      minor scrapes on the piston and pump bore but suspect those were made
      during fabrication and not a result of the freeze up.&nbsp; Maybe the
      screeching was due to water being forced past the O-Ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      O-Ring looked OK, but was replaced
      anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
