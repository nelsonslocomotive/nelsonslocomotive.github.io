    <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">After the initial streaming test on December 3,
    2003 many deficiencies were corrected and then additional tests were
    conducted in December and January that revealed several additional problems
    described here.&nbsp; More corrections were made when everything was
    disassembled for painting.&nbsp; Then&nbsp; additional tests were conducted
    in April which revealed a few more problems that were quickly repaired.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Finally, on April 21st the burner was test again and seemed to run great
    ---- this thing is ready for the track.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
     
    <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">Note that I've described the
    winding path I've taken to get this burner working properly for several
    reasons.&nbsp; One reason is encourage folks to keep at it when building a
    live steam locomotive ---- things often don't work perfectly the first
    time.&nbsp; A second reason is that maybe you all can develop a feel for how
    the burner should run from my experience.&nbsp; While writing this summary,
    I realized that I didn't know how&nbsp; a proper burner should operate since
    I'd never operated one ---- sort of like a hunting elephants when you've
    never seen an elephant.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've summarized the operation of the
    burner at the end to tie everything
    together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

            December 16th.&nbsp; Note the snow on the grown.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
            about freezing at the time of the test.&nbsp;
            <p>The burner didn't seem to run very well-- it went out
            often.&nbsp; I then opened the fire box door slightly as shown on the
            right and everything worked great --- burner was very
            stable.&nbsp;&nbsp; That indicated a little more more air was needed
            at the back of the fire pan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chester Peterson had vents
            at the back of the fire pan in his design so decided to make that
            modification.</td>

    <p><b>January 29th Test:</b> Between December 16th and this test on January
    29th the cab roof, whistle and steam powered pump were fabricated and
    installed.&nbsp; The snow was deeper on the 29th as seen in the photo above
    and it was pretty cold ---- about 15 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark Mihalyi had
    come over from near Pittsburgh and we both froze.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Two 5/8&quot; vent holes had been added to the rear of the fire pan and
    that seem to fix the burner&nbsp; --- it was very reliable.&nbsp; The pump
    and the modified brakes with both steam powered application and release all
    worked great.&nbsp; The whistle however didn't work very well ---- too cold
    --- the steam condensed and it spit more than it whistled.&nbsp; Hopefully
    it'll work better in warmer weather.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only other
    problem noticed was that the blower seemed to be less effective than on previous
    tests.&nbsp; Several of the blower holes were found to be plugged when
    it was later disassembled for painting.&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine had been run
    quite a bit on compressed air and the lubricator was supplying too much oil,
    much of which ended up on the blower&nbsp; It was probably this excess oil that plugged the blower holes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This test was cut short after about an hour when one of the water pipes
    froze.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were were glad to get inside and warm
    up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            spark arrangement to relight his oil burner.&nbsp;&nbsp;More
            recently we exchanged a number of emails in which he described the
            sparker he used.&nbsp; He suggested a a kerosene heater plug (more
            than&nbsp; $10) screwed in the bottom of the fire pan about 3/4 of
            the way toward the back.&nbsp; The plug takes a 14 mm
            tap.&nbsp;&nbsp; I figured I'd save some $$$$ and buy a lawn mower
            plug.&nbsp; The local hardware store carried the heater plug and
            once I saw one (photo on right) it was clear why Dave likes them
            ---- look at the length of those electrodes.&nbsp;</td>

          <td>The plug is threaded 14mm with 1.25 mm pitch and my 14 mm tap had
            a larger pitch.&nbsp; The fire pan is too low on the shay to have
            the plug sticking out the bottom of the fire pan so the holder in
            above photo was fabricated.&nbsp; The plug is a very loose fit it
            the holder (so it hopefully won't rust in place) and is retained by
            the screw.&nbsp; It is a tight fit after the screw is
            tightened.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plug is at a 45 degree angle.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Note that the fire pan had been powder coated with a high
            temperature powder made for auto exhaust
            manifolds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            the plug in position.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave has an adjustable damper on his
            burner so I added the hinged flap damper.&nbsp; The cleat on the end holds
            the damper in position.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two vent holes mentioned
            earlier are visible under the flap.&nbsp; That seemed to be enough
            air on the previous test so no need for more holes.&nbsp; There is
            some leakage around the plug holder so it may be necessary to close
            the damper more than shown n the photo.&nbsp;</td>

            difficulty getting the nuts started on the studs.&nbsp; I found that
            socket head cap screws worked better for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The edges

    <p><b>April 15 test:&nbsp;</b> April 15 is a day I normally dread as I wait
    to mail my income tax payment while grumbling about it all day.&nbsp; This
    year I was due a refund so it was mailed in early February.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    refund arrived weeks ago and has already been used to stimulate the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The day was bright and sunny so I spent all morning and most the afternoon
    cleaning up limbs and other debris from her lawn.&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll take
    another few hours before the lawn is clear enough to run the
    mower.&nbsp;&nbsp; (She's already fertilized it ---- I keep hoping she
    applies Roundup by mistake.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, by about 4 pm I was
    exhausted, sore and not in a good mood ---- like a normal April 15th.</p>
    <p>Wheeled the&nbsp; shay out on the walkway, put some diesel in the fuel
    tank and filled the tender. Connected the compressed and used the steam
    powered pump to fill the boiler.&nbsp; Just when I got it to the correct
    level, the pump quit.&nbsp; Drats!</p>
    <p>I tried to light the burner with the igniter --- not luck.&nbsp; It lit
    easily with the propane torch.&nbsp; After it ran for a few minutes, I shut
    off the atomizer air valve to extinguish the flame and then turned it back
    on.&nbsp; The igniter easily relit the burner.&nbsp; At least that part
    worked slick.&nbsp; Through that test I used the igniter several dozen times
    and it worked every time.&nbsp; The igniter can be labeled finished!&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Tested a number of variations of throttle opening and fuel, atomizer and
    blower settings.&nbsp; The atomizer seemed to run fine at 8 to 10
    psi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The burner seemed to produce the best heat with 25 psi
    or greater blower when engine is not running..&nbsp;&nbsp; When running, the
    exhaust creates a draft so the blower can be cut back.&nbsp; It looks like
    leaving the blower on about 10 psi when running will keep the burner running
    if the throttle is closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There were several problems uncovered:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The burner seemed to be relatively insensitive to the fuel valve
        setting and it was impossible to make it rich enough to produce white
        smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      </li>
      <li>The burner would go out at full throttle unless the door was cracked
        indicating more air was required.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The most serious problem was that some of the fire came out around the
        spark plug hole and burned the insulation on the plug wire.&nbsp; This
        had been a problem from the first test&nbsp; ---- to much heat coming out
        around the back of the fire pan.&nbsp; Bob Reedy and Chest Peterson
        angled their nozzles up slightly --- maybe to fix this problem.<br>
      </li>
      <li>After everything was shut down I checked the smoke stack to see if the
        change in the lubricator piston size had reduced the amount of oil
        dripping down the side of the stack.&nbsp; There was no dripping ---
        good.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there was a big puddle under the lubricator.
        Bad! (It was really bad when she noticed it on her cedar
        walkway.)&nbsp; I then noticed oil bubbles coming out the lubricator
        vent hole (there was still some boiler pressure) indicating the ball
        check in the lubricator output wasn't checking very
        well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul>
&nbsp;At that point I was sore, tired, dirty and discouraged.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next day I went out to Mill Creek Central and helped Dick McCloy move a few
    things around his track.&nbsp; That lifted my sprits. That evening I went to
    work on the lubricator and pump.&nbsp; The lubricator problem was that the
    output pipe protruded into the side of the output chamber and pushed against
    the side of the ball check keeping it from seating.&nbsp; This was probably
    done after painting when I tightened all the connections.&nbsp; It was fixed by
    cutting off the end of the pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem with the steam
    powered water pump was that the lower end of the pilot valve stem had come
    unscrewed&nbsp; --- must have not tighten it sufficiently when reassembled
    after painting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two problems fixed already and my spirits were really
    up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Nozzle Angle: </b>The top of the brass block that holds the
            nozzle was milled at about a 12 degree angle so the nozzle points at
            a spot about an inch above the bottom of the fire
            box.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      </table>
      </center>
    </div>
    <p><b>Fuel Flow: </b>The nozzle was checked and verified&nbsp;to be clear.&nbsp; Next, the flow at the output of the filter was
    checked.&nbsp;&nbsp; The flow didn't increase after the valve was opened about
    1/2 turn.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was only about 1 inch of fuel left in the
    tank.&nbsp; I filled up the tank and opened the valve again.&nbsp; There was
    much greater flow when the valve was opened.&nbsp; This indicated there may
    be a problem with very low fuel level.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>April 17th Test:&nbsp; </b>Fired it up again on April
    17th.&nbsp;&nbsp; The good news was that the burner worked much better ---
    greatly reduced heat around the back of the boiler (I was beginning to
    wonder if I really wanted foot pegs&nbsp; ---- it looked too hot down
    there).&nbsp;&nbsp; The larger rear fire pan vent worked better, could keep the fire going at
    full throttle with door closed.&nbsp; Also noticed better fuel control and
    could make it smoke a little with a rich flame.&nbsp; Also noticed a relationship
    between the amount of blower, smoke and fuel setting ---- i.e., increased
    fuel caused white smoke, increased blower leaned it out and it stopped
    smoking.&nbsp; This was all as I initially expected.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Another piece of good news --- the lubricator
    wasn't bubbling
    oil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This test was for about an hour.&nbsp; Whistle worked great ---&nbsp;
    recall that it just spit in freezing weather.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a few
    small steam leaks but I'm getting used to them --- that might be easier than
    actually stopping the leaks.&nbsp; The Teflon packing in the engine rod and
    valve stem glands worked really great.&nbsp; I did notice that the rod
    bearing on the rear cylinder is a little loose.&nbsp; Maybe I can mill the
    joint between the two halves slightly and then ream it
    again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I shut everything down again I noticed
    bubbles on the lubricator vent again.&nbsp; Even so, it was a good day.</p>
    <p><b>The Lubricator Again:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>This time I cleaned the
    lubricator up before working on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a
    mess!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; The steam that backed up through the lubricator tank
    turned the steam oil into a thick sticky grease --- it must have washed out
    the tallow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't see anything wrong with the ball
    check valve but did see some small pieces of copper from the end of the
    output pipe I cut off last time.&nbsp; That might have been holding the ball
    off the seat.&nbsp; Also, maybe it was just the grease left from the last
    time steam got into the tank ---- I didn't clean it out that time.&nbsp; I
    did drill out the seat slightly to (hopefully) make a better sealing seat.&nbsp;
    I later tested it running the engine on compressed air.&nbsp; First, the
    output was left open at the union next to the steam input header to verify
    that it pumped oil to that point.&nbsp; The union was then connected and
    engine run for about 20 minutes; no bubbling from the
    lubricator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note: I had
    further trouble with the lubricator and later changed the design to use a
    poppet check valve.&nbsp; This change is documented on the <a href="../../Plumbing/PlumbingIII/PlumbingIII.htm">Lubricator</a>
    page.&nbsp;</p>

      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="720">
        <tr>
          <td><b>New Fuel Filter:&nbsp;</b> I discussed my concern about the
            fuel filter and low fuel level with Dave Johnson and he said that it sounded like I
            wasn't getting enough fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp; He uses a fine screen and
            pointed out that the nozzle fuel opening is really pretty big and
            not much of a filter is required.&nbsp; He suggested that a screen
            or filter designed for engines without fuel pumps was
            appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <p>I then did an Internet search for small engine fuel filter and
            found a number of references to filter of sizes as small as 10
            microns to the Briggs &amp; Stratton #298090 that is 150
            microns.&nbsp; Took that number and went to the local TSC (Tractor
            Supply Center) where I found a Briggs &amp; Stratton No 5018 shown
            on the right.&nbsp; On the back of the package it says its the same
            as #298090.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Before disconnecting the old auto type filter I measured the time
            required to fill a small bottle with the valve wide open.&nbsp; I
            then did the same test with this red filter and found that it took
            about 1/3 the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    <p><b>April 21 Test: </b>The locomotive was fired up again on the test stand
    to check the operation with the new filter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The operation
    finally seemed correct.&nbsp; Some of the key points were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It was possible to increase the fuel feed to the point that the fire
        smoked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>&nbsp;It was possible to reduce the smoke by increasing the blower or
        opening the throttle.</li>
      <li>If the fuel was adjusted for no smoke at low blower or throttle, the
        fire went out when the blower was open to maximum or the throttle opened
        to max.&nbsp;&nbsp; This makes sense, the blower and exhaust supply more
        air and lean the mixture.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>The minimum burner setting generated enough heat to get to and
        maintain over 100 psi pressure so if the locomotive is stopped for a
        while with the burner on, the safety valve will be operating constantly
        --- distracting.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>One way to minimize the safety valve going off when stopped was to add
        water; this lowers the temperature and stores the energy from the heat
        in the form of more hot water.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Good operation was achieved with the damper at the rear of the fire
        pan about half open.&nbsp; This will need further checking under
        load.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>A noticeable soot collected on the inside of the smokestack and some collected
        in the tubes.&nbsp; Clearly, a smoky fire generates soot.&nbsp; Baring
        any new data, will run fuel adjustment just to the leaner side of where
        it smokes to minimize soot buildup. &nbsp;</li>
      <li>Soot buildup will require cleaning the tubes periodically.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>The lubricator used some oil and none leaked out the bottom of the
        lubricator. Also, there was none deposited on the smokestack so the oil
        feed amount is probably about right.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The locomotive is ready for a test at the track.</p>
    <p><b>April 28: </b>Took it to the track today and it ran pretty for
    about 90 minutes and then a few problems developed.&nbsp; This first
    operation will be discussed in the operation section.&nbsp; The burner modifications described here
    seemed to work well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
