    <p>The basis for burner
    described here is Bob Reedy's&nbsp; burner for his Three-Truck Climax described in the
    May/June 2003 issue of <u>Live Steam </u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Update 4/28/04:</b> After a number of tests the burner described here
    was modified,&nbsp; see <a href="../BurnerTestMods/TestsBurnerMods.htm"><font face="Arial">Shay

    <p><font face="Arial"> <b>Update 9/23/05:</b>&nbsp; The fire pan was 
    redesigned with much improved results.&nbsp; See<a href="../../Operation/MoreImprovements/More%20Improvements.htm">

            Reedy's design The sides slide into the firebox rather then being
            bent over like the ends.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nozzle is outside the box
            to give more room for the flame.&nbsp; The air/steam pipe is

            threaded&nbsp; 10-32 on one end and MTP on the&nbsp; other were
            fabricated.&nbsp; The regulator end of the nipples were initially sealed with Teflon
            washers and nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Teflon leaked at higher temperatures
            and when the nuts were tightened to add pressure on the Teflon, it
            mere squeezed out the sides.&nbsp; The Teflon washers were replaced
            with aluminum washers which sealed properly.&nbsp; &nbsp;
            <p>This is the view looking down on regulator.&nbsp; (The platform
            cover is removed.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The two brass 1/8&quot; pipe street
            elbows rest on the platform top and provide support for the
            gauge.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The regulator is rated at 230 degrees F so this application will
            stretch it a bit.&nbsp; Unions are used on the connections so that
