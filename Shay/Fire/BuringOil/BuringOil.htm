    <p>I've had no experience with generating steam so I read a lot, sought the
    advice of others and then ran a few tests.&nbsp; This page describes some of
    what I've learned and also a describes some early tests of an oil burner nozzle.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With one exception, all the local guys I've met at the Mill Creek Central
    (MCC) track in Coshocton, Ohio burn coal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's not
    surprising since Ohio has abundant coal supplies ---- the MCC track is
    located on land that was strip-mined 50 or 60 years ago.&nbsp; As a youth 50
    years ago I witnessed the last few years of the steam locomotives hauling
    coal from the mines in southeast Ohio to the power plants along the south
    side of Lake Eire.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were several trains per day over the
    B&amp;O single track that ran through my village ---- each train had about
    100 cars
    pulled by two huge locomotives.&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember being held up at the
    tracks on the way to school.&nbsp; The strongest recollection is the immense
    size of the locomotives and the rails&nbsp; moving up and down as the trucks
    rolled over them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Even&nbsp; though coal is abundant is the area there is a problem
    securing small quantities.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no problem if one wants a
    few thousand tons but a 50 pound sack is hard to obtain.&nbsp; Coal
    is also very dirty.&nbsp; The ashes mix with the dripping water and oil into
    a dirty, sticky, grimy paste very similar to the deposits I find under my
    British roadsters (if an auto doesn't leak fluids, it ain't British).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I have a board walk around the house that connects with the walkway from the
    basement workshop.&nbsp; The plan is to push the the locomotive on the
    transporter-test stand out on the board walkway for testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spouse's
    reaction to a hole in the walk burned by hot ashes is something I don't
    want to experience. &nbsp; I've not seen any scale stokers for live steam
    locomotives so the operator must also shovel the coal.&nbsp; Being a novice, that's probably
    a distraction I don't need.&nbsp; Considering all this, I decided against coal, at least for
    now.</p>
    <p>Kenneth suggests propane to fire the locomotive.&nbsp; I've never seen a
    propane fired live steamer.&nbsp; However, others who have think it's a
    great choice.&nbsp; It's clean and readily
    available.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kenneth said he built two shays at the same time, one
    oil fired and the other propane fired.&nbsp; He said the propane fired one
    had more power and was cleaner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drawback with propane
    is that a car is required to carry the two propane tanks (I understand that
    dual tanks operating in parallel are required to deliver the necessary fuel
    without freezing.&nbsp; This is probably because the most economical tanks
    and/or regulators are designed for applications that require less fuel.&nbsp;
    I've had the regulator for my Sievert torch freeze up when using the largest
    burner for an extended period.)&nbsp;&nbsp; If one has a two truck shay,
    then an additional car is required for the engineer and that car could be
    used to haul the tanks.&nbsp; For my three truck shay, the engineer rides on
    the tender; I'd prefer to not have to haul another car just for the
    fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Oil is the obvious choice in terms of size (oil tank), availability, ease
    of delivery (don't have to shovel) and lack of ashes.&nbsp; The problem with
    oil is to make it burn and to keep it burning.&nbsp; The only technique that
    I'm aware of to fire with oil is to mix the oil with steam to atomize the
    fuel.&nbsp; Compressed air can be used to atomize the fuel when initially
    building steam.&nbsp; The compressed air can also be used to in the blower
    to generate a draft when starting.&nbsp; A problem with oil is that the fire
    seems to go out from time-to-time.&nbsp;&nbsp; (This is not a problem with
    coal and apparently not with propane.)&nbsp; The flameout may be due a rapid change in steam
    pressure affecting the draft or the atomizer pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many if
    not most the people who burn oil use a auto coil - spark plug combination to relight
    the burner after a flameout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Randy Sutherland is the one individual I see frequently at MCC who burns
    oil.&nbsp;&nbsp; Randy has given me a great deal of&nbsp; information about
    burning oil, much of which is scattered through this page.&nbsp; The next
    photo shows Randy on his Mikado.&nbsp; The photo was taken in June of
    2003.&nbsp; Unfortunately I was out of town in June and didn't see Randy and
    his Mikado in action.&nbsp; The photo shows three Mikados, that's Randy in
    front, Joe Scales on the second engine and Bruce Saylor is running the third
    engine&nbsp; Bruce's engine is also oil fired.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Randy.jpg" width="700" height="407" ></p>
    <p>In late October I met Bruce Saylor from Pennsylvania and Dave Johnson from Virginia&nbsp;
    at MCC.&nbsp; Both Bruce and Dave burn oil.&nbsp; I had a chance to see them in operation and they seemed to run very
    well.&nbsp; I had a long chat with Dave pictured below.&nbsp;</p>

          <td>Dave uses a small Clippard regulator on the atomizer line.&nbsp;
            He has a pressure gauge on the line and sets the regulator pressure
            to 8 psi.&nbsp; He has a small opening in the firebox door as shown
            in the photo on the right.&nbsp; The opening allows the flame to be
            observed. The hole can be covered with the little teardrop
            flap.&nbsp;
            <p>While chatting with Dave, his burner went out a couple
            times.&nbsp; He easily relit it by pushing a little switch that
            controlled a coil-spark plug arrangement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Unfortunately, I failed to observe the position of the sparkplug
            relative to the nozzle.</p>
            <p>Dave located his fuel valve in the bottom inside of the fuel tank
            with the control knob on top the tank lid directly above the
            valve.&nbsp; A simple design worth copying.</td>

    <p>Kenneth said he used the burner described by Chester
    Peterson in <u>SO YOU WANT TO BUILD A LIVE STEAM </u><u>LOCOMOTIVE</u>.&nbsp;
    Bob Reedy describes a similar burner for his Three-truck Climax in the
    May/June 2003 issue of <u> Live Steam</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reedy's Climax is a similar
    size to the my shay so I decided to follow his design.&nbsp; While waiting
    for the boiler to arrive in the fall of 2003 a number of small
    parts were fabricated including the burner nozzle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            test the nozzle and make sure it operated properly.&nbsp; I also
            wanted to become familiar with burning oil.&nbsp; So, put a valve in
            the bottom of the oil tank similar to that used by Dave, had some
            kerosene available for fuel and used a regulator in the compressed
            air line to supply the
            atomizer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            the back of a short section of 6&quot; pipe.&nbsp; The clear plastic
            tube is the atomizer (air) line.&nbsp; &nbsp;
            <p>A propane torch was used to light the burner. Wow, what a
            flame!&nbsp; It sounded like one of those salamander
            heaters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The photo below shows the flame output.&nbsp; That fire didn't do
            the ivy any good.&nbsp;&nbsp; The deer ate the ivy bare a couple
            weeks later so I was able to blame the deer for the fire
            damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The spouse has had eye surgery and now
            sees much better.&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll probably be really difficult to
            sneak things by her now.)</td>

    <p align="left">After savoring the delight of a really hot flame I tried
    adjusting the atomizing pressure and the fuel flow.&nbsp; The gauge on the
    air pressure was not accurate at low pressure so I didn't&nbsp; learn much
    except that the burner wasn't very sensitive as long as the pressure was
    above a few psi and less than maybe 20 psi.&nbsp; The burner was also
    relatively insensitive to the fluid valve.&nbsp; There was only an inch or
    so of fuel in the tank and the nozzle was only about an inch below&nbsp; the
    tank so very little pressure could develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The flame is very long.&nbsp; The hottest point is probably
    near the end of the flame.&nbsp; The pipe is 8&quot; long so the hottest
    point of the flame is about 24&quot; from the tip of the nozzle.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The fire pan for the boiler is 8&quot; long so if the flame goes along the
    bottom, up the back and then toward the front and out the tubes, the hottest
    point will be near the tube sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flame might be
    shortened somewhat if the fuel is reduced some.&nbsp; Maybe the&nbsp; nozzle
    could be moved outside the front of the pan to give a little more
    length.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I had wondered whether the spark from an igniter like used in a propane
    grill would work to relight the burner flame.&nbsp; I purchased a
    replacement unit at the local hardware store to test.&nbsp; The sparking
    part was located at the end of the pipe.&nbsp; The fuel was tuned off, flame
    went out, turned fuel back on and operated the igniter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    burner relit --- wow that was great.&nbsp; Decided to test various locations
    of the sparking part.&nbsp; Couldn't get the burner to relight again with
    the sparking part in any position including the original position that
    worked once.&nbsp; (And yes, the thing still sparked.)&nbsp; Peterson
    suggests placing the sparkplug about the middle of the fire pan but that was
    a larger locomotive.&nbsp; Decided to try to learn where others have placed
    the spark plug on small locomotives before fooling with it any
    more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A last point on the fuel --- the choices are heating&nbsp; oil, diesel
    fuel and kerosene.&nbsp; I had been told that diesel and fuel oil have a
    much higher heat content than kerosene.&nbsp; I did a bit of research on the
    internet and found that heating oil and diesel fuel have 139,000 BTU/gallon
    while kerosene has 135,000 BTU/gallon.&nbsp; This ~ 3% difference is not
    worth worrying about.&nbsp;&nbsp; Heating oil is difficult for me to obtain
    by the 5 gallon can so the practical choices for me are diesel fuel or
    kerosene.&nbsp; I understand that there is some difference in the combustion
    byproducts of the kerosene and diesel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kerosene is used in
    unvented space heaters so the fumes are probably not too toxic, especially
    since I'll be doing the burning outside.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I'll use
    kerosene until I lean more about diesel fuel.</p>
    <p>Update: I ended up using Diesel fuel because it is more readily available
    and costs less than kerosene even with the huge road tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
