      <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">The burner was lit and steam
      generated for the first time on December 3, 2003.&nbsp; That's about 14
      months after work started on the locomotive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is
      a brief description of that first firing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">The transporter with locomotive
      was rolled out of the workshop onto the board walk behind the house.&nbsp;
      The boiler was filled about halfway up the water gauge and fuel tank was
      filled about one third with kerosene.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compressed air was
      connected and the boiler was cut off from the compressed air.&nbsp; The
      blower valve was opened&nbsp;some to give good draft, the atomizer valve opened
      and the regulator set to 10 psi.&nbsp; The fuel valve was then opened and
      the fire lit with a propane
      torch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
     
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Fire.jpg"></p>
    <p>After some fooling with the controls stable flame was achieved with 10
    psi atomizer pressure and about 45 degrees rotation of the fuel
    valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo above shows the burner flame.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
    the blower was turned down some the flame would start to come out the front
    opening in the fire pan indicating insufficient draft.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The value of the blower
    pressure gauge is now clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; I may temporarily substitute an air
    pressure gauge while waiting for the correct gauge to
    arrive.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Adjustment of the fuel valve around the 45 degree opening seemed to have
    little effect.&nbsp; The valve could be opened to at least 90 degrees and
    the flame was still fairly stable.&nbsp; There was no noticeable smoke from
    the smokestack ----- maybe the flame was a bit lean.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    temperature of the exhaust was such that I could hold my hand over the smoke
    stack (having never fired a locomotive before, wasn't sure what to expect).</p>
    <p>After about 10 minutes steam started to come out around the engine
    plumbing ------ I had opened the throttle slightly to bleed off any
    compressed air and failed to close it.&nbsp; So --- had water boiling in
    about 10 minutes.&nbsp; That is faster than expected.&nbsp; Closed the
    throttle and the pressure climbed to 100 psi in about another 5
    minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The safety valves then operated as shown in next
    photo.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="SafetyValves.JPG"></p>
    <p>When the safety valves operated the pressure dropped to about 80 psi and
    it took a bit for the valves to shut off.&nbsp; My guess is that the safety
    valve exhaust
    holes are too big.&nbsp; Will experiment with that in the future.</p>
    <p>The next step was to open the throttle.&nbsp; The engine started, a lot
    of steam around the engine, and the fire went out.&nbsp; Fooled around a bit
    and then stopped to think (if all else fails ......).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    engine exhaust creates more draft which would tend to lean the flame.&nbsp;
    Try more fuel.&nbsp; It worked, at about 90 degrees on the fuel valve the
    flame stayed lit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this process, the fire had to be
    relit several times, each with a little (or not so little) poof.&nbsp; The
    fire pan had been just pushed on and was retained by the sides pressing against the
    inside walls of the firebox.&nbsp; One of the relights generated more of a bang
    than a poof causing the fire pan to exit the firebox.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple
    bricks under the fire pan solved that
    problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Next, the transition from air to steam for the atomizer and blower was
    tested&nbsp; The first attempt there seemed to be no pressure.&nbsp; Now
    suspect there was water in the line.&nbsp; Another relight and then adjusted
    the air regulator to 40 psi and opened the valve between the boiler and the
    atomizer/blower manifold.&nbsp;&nbsp; The check valve kept the steam out of
    the air line and the transition went smoother and&nbsp; flame didn't
    seem to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Next, took a closer look at the steam exiting around the engine.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="SteamLeaks.JPG"></p>
    <p align="left">Noticed that the screws on the steam pipe connection at the
    right end of the steam header hadn't been tightened.&nbsp; That was the
    biggest leak.&nbsp; After those screws were tightened, the engine was at
    least visible.</p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="FirstTest.JPG"></p>
    <p>There are still leaks around the piston rods and the valve stems so the
    packing glands need to be tightened. (The engine was finished nearly a year
    ago; at that time steam leaks were a faint hope.)&nbsp;&nbsp; This first
    test was a success ---- better than expected.&nbsp; Now, it's time to fix
    the leaks, clean up a number of open items and then make some more controlled
    tests.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the immediate tasks are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix engine leaks.</li>
      <li>Get a blower pressure gage</li>
      <li>Drill and tap holes in the center of the upper heads so that W40 can
        be squirted into the cylinders after use.</li>
      <li>Drill and tap hole for and then mount blowdown valve (needed to fill
        boiler).</li>
      <li>Move upper water gauge input from turret to boiler.</li>
      <li>Move pressure gauge to top center of backhead. (Friend Dan Staron said
        that is where he wants his pressure gauge.&nbsp; One of the Cass engines
        has the gauge in that location.&nbsp; The gauge in that position will
        allow the cab roof&nbsp; to extend further to the rear.)</li>
      <li>Install and plumb the steam brake valve.</li>
      <li>Install adjustable covers over the hole in the front of the fire
        pan.&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, I wasn't able to make the flame
        too rich.&nbsp; Maybe it's just right, but want to test with a
        richer flame and then back off.</li>
      <li>Install the studs to retain the fire pan (probably works better than a
        couple bricks).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Install the lubricator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>And many more things I can't think of at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that it works, it'll be easier to tackle these tasks with more
    patience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should have them completed and be into more
    controlled tests by Christmas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
