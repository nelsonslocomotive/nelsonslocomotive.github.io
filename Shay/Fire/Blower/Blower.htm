    <p>The blower is the last thing needed to fire up the locomotive.&nbsp; The
    blower nozzle had been made earlier and installed with the the exhaust
    pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The smokestack base had been installed when the holes were
    drilled in the boiler.&nbsp; The blower valve was installed in conjunction
    with the blower/atomizer manifold.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The work remaining is to run the pipe from the the valve to the blower,
    install a pressure gauge on the blower line and to screw down the smokestack
    and petticoat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, a pressure relief is to installed on
    the blower line to protect the relatively low scale ( 0-30 psi) pressure
    gauge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blower pipe runs down the right side stay
    tube.&nbsp; The pressure gauge sets on the reversing gear platform behind
    and above the atomizer pressure gauge.&nbsp; The relief valve is attached to
    the blower pipe line in the smoke&nbsp; box.</p>

          <td>The blower valve is the upper of the two valves on the
            manifold.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo shows that a tee is connected via a
            short nipple to the union on the valve.&nbsp; The right leg of the
            tee goes via another union and an elbow to a compression fritting that
            transitions to 1/8&quot; pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The elbows and other
            fittings form a base for the blower pressure gauge ordered a few
            weeks ago but hasn't arrived yet.&nbsp; The union on the right side
            of the tee permits removing the gauge so that the platform and&nbsp;
            shelf can be removed. The left leg of the tee goes through 3 elbows
            and then enters the stay tube.</td>

            to show the fittings. Note that there are unions at each each end of
            the link that connects the blower pipe with the
            blower.&nbsp; The unions permit easy removal of the the link so that
            either end and the link itself can be worked on.&nbsp; The safety
            valve is set for 30 psi to protect the gauge.&nbsp;
            <p>Update:&nbsp; The blower was modified and pressures greater than
            30 psi were usable so the gauge was replace with a 0-60 psi
            gauge.&nbsp; The relief valve at this point is of little use and
            will be removed.&nbsp;</p>
