    <p align="left">The November/December 2003 issue of Live Steam&nbsp; has a neat
    brake valve design for a three-truck Climax.&nbsp; The design by Bob Reedy
    is really two valves, a locomotive steam brake valve and a smaller train air
    brake valve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The locomotive brake uses O ring seals whereas
    the train brake uses a Teflon plug.&nbsp; I decided to use a physical appearance
    similar to Reedy's locomotive brake but try a Teflon sleeve similar to the design
    used for the <a href="../../Engine/CylinderCocks/CylinderCocks.htm">cylinder
    cocks</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Recall that I had the steam and air valves reversed so

    <p align=left>The model worked and made a pretty good seal.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Next, a model was made using a 3/4&quot; sleeve OD and a 7/16&quot; plug
    OD.&nbsp;&nbsp; The valve worked pretty well, leaked slightly at room
    temperature with 125 psi air applied and leaked only a little in boiling water.&nbsp;&nbsp; The handle was a
    little hard to turn.&nbsp; Tried another sleeve with a smaller ID to put more
    pressure on the sleeve and body ---- no difference in force or small
    leak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried yet again with similar results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>Many years of engineering experience have taught that there is
    a time to leave the lab and do a bit if thinking about the engineering principles
    ---- and that time had arrived for the brake valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some
    thought yielded the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><b>Teflon is pliant: </b>Teflon is a very tough
        material, hard to tear and slippery which are properties that make it
        good for sealing.&nbsp; Another&nbsp; property is that it is pliant
        which is also necessary for a good seal.&nbsp; However, the pliability
        means that as pressure is applied on the sleeve between the body and
        plug, the Teflon tends to ooze out the ends of the body.&nbsp; That is
        why no improved sealing was achieved by forcing the plug into a smaller
        ID sleeve --- the extra Teflon oozed out the ends of the
        body.&nbsp;&nbsp; The maximum pressure is related to the sleeve
        thickness ----- the thinner the sleeve,&nbsp; the greater the maximum
        pressure.&nbsp; The cylinder cocks sealed pretty well with a 1/32&quot;
        sleeve thickness.&nbsp; Several different brake valve sleeve thicknesses
        were tried.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thickness of 1/64&quot;&nbsp; worked but was
        touchy; sometimes the sleeve tore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A thickness of
        1/16&quot; didn't seal very well at 125 psi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Conclusion ---&nbsp; 1/32&quot; is a good workable choice.&nbsp; (A
        different approach would be to seal the ends of the body so that the
        Teflon couldn't ooze out.&nbsp; That was not used because there was no
        obvious way to accommodate sleeve swelling under higher
        temperatures.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><b>Pressure maintains the seal:</b>&nbsp; The seal is
        maintained by pressure, not force.&nbsp; That's sort of obvious --- the
        steam pressure is tending to compress the Teflon and the resilience of
        the Teflon is pushing back.&nbsp;&nbsp; The area of the seal is less
        important except that a larger area will reduce leaks due to small imperfections.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><b>Plug Rotating Force is Proportional to Plug Surface
        Area: </b>The same sealing pressure is required to maintain a seal
        independent of the plug size.&nbsp;&nbsp; The friction force between the
        plug and the sleeve is proportional to the pressure on the surface
        multiplied by the surface area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plug surface area
        and hence the friction force is proportional to the plug
        radius (and diameter).<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><b>Torque: </b>The plug is rotated by a lever so the
        force of interest is a rotating force or torque.&nbsp; The torque
        required for a given force on the sleeve-plug interface is proportion to
        the plug radius (also diameter).&nbsp; Hence when 3 &amp; 4 are
        combined, the torque to rotate the plug is proportional to the square of
        the plug diameter. &nbsp;<b><br>
        </b></li>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><b>Pressure Between Sleeve and Body:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The
        total force (pressure X surface area) between the plug and sleeve is the
        same as between the sleeve and the body.&nbsp; On one model with a
        3/4&quot; OD sleeve and 3/8&quot; there was a leak between the sleeve
        and body.&nbsp;&nbsp; After trying several sleeves a little thought
        revealed that the sleeve OD area was nearly twice the ID area hence the
        sealing pressure on the OD was roughly half the sealing pressure on the
        ID.&nbsp; No wonder the the sleeve-body interface was the most likely to leak.</li>
    </ol>
    <p align="left">After thinking about the above points, , the following dimensions were
    selected:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p align="left">1/4&quot; plug diameter (smaller is better but limited
        by hole diameter)<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;5/16&quot; hole in body (this is sleeve OD which
        gives a 1/32&quot; sleeve thickness)<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">1/2&quot; long plug working surface (this size looks
        good)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

    <hr>
    <p align="left">OK, now that I've learned I had the two brake valves mixed
    up what a I going to do?&nbsp; I have a valve that can be used to control
    the steam brakes but is in the air brake position.&nbsp; Of course, it can control an injector for train vacuum
    brakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I'll make another valve ---- at least
    another valve mounting arrangement in the more correct position for the
    steam brake.&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is more to it than just the valve location.
    The following is part of the note that Mike Green sent describing the steam
    brake operation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <p align=left><b>J</b><i><b>ust opened up your site today and noticed that
    you have added the Brake Valve installment.&nbsp; Having ridden on #5 in the
    past I think that you have the two brake valves reversed in your captions
    for the first pictures.&nbsp; The valve with the long stem directly in front
    of the Engineer is the loco steam brake.&nbsp; The larger valve unit under
    the throttle lever is the Westinghouse valve for the train air brake
    control.&nbsp; I didn't follow the three pipes descending from the steam
    valve but one applies the brakes, while another feeds the back side of the
    cylinders to keep the brakes off, the third one is the exhaust.&nbsp; The
    Engineer was constantly moving the valve probably because of a disc leak at
    that time and the application side was showing some pressure.&nbsp; The
    horizontal pipe would be the steam supply leading up to the stop valve on
    the main manifold.&nbsp; The reason I was told for the extended valve
    spindle was to keep the heat of the hot valve from getting into the handle
    and allow a machinist to be able to re-pack the top gland without
    dismantling the whole thing, with the gloves of today, the hot handle wouldn't be
    too much of a concern.</b>
    </i></p>
    <p align=left>I haven't seen any models that use steam release (backoff) of
    the brakes.&nbsp; My brakes hang up a bit on release and was thinking of
    using heavier return springs.&nbsp; However, the thought of using steam release
    is really intriguing........&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>Mike also sent a copy of Lima I<u>nstruction Sheet No 10</u>&nbsp;
    that describes the operation of the Lima Steam Brake.&nbsp; Turns out that I
    also had a copy.&nbsp; Both our copies came from a booklet of Lima
    Instruction Sheets published by Kyle Neighbors of Cass&nbsp; WV.&nbsp; The
    following is a scan of the two page Instruction Sheet No 10.</p>

    <p><b>Update (12/12/03):&nbsp;</b> I fabricated a steam brake valve
    along the lines of the valve describe above shortly after Mike pointed out
    my errors on the first try.&nbsp; I delayed updating
    this page&nbsp; until the valve was installed and operating the cylinder.&nbsp; The
    boiler arrived in the mean time so I was off working on getting it installed
    and plumbing the water and steam.&nbsp; The locomotive is about ready for
    the first run at the track and assuming that it actually gets moving, brakes
    might be a nice feature to help stop it.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, hooked up the
    brakes.</p>

            <p>The valve works great! The return springs on the brakes were
            removed.&nbsp; (The return spring on the park brake lever was left
            in place.)&nbsp; It takes about two seconds for the brake pistons to
            move after the brakes are applied.&nbsp; The speed is controlled by
            the pipe and valve size.&nbsp; This speed is probably good; we weren't
            designing a steam catapult.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the test stand it's
            possible to control the braking force by moving the valve on and
            off.&nbsp; It'll be interesting to see how the brakes work on an
            engine and string of cars with a little momentum.
            <p>Thanks to Mike Green for steering me to this neat design. &nbsp;</td>

    <p><b>Update 1/30/2004: </b><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;The valve
    worked OK on compressed air but sometimes would not pass steam, especially
    under lower pressure such as less than 50 psi.&nbsp;&nbsp; I modified the
    the valve by drilling the passages larger.&nbsp; This fixed the blockage
    problem but the clearances were reduced with the larger passages and the
    valve developed a small leak.&nbsp;&nbsp; One solution would be to make a
    new valve designed with larger passages.&nbsp; A valve with 3/32&quot;
    passages would be satisfactory and this size passage could probably be
    achieved reliably with a 3/8&quot; valve plug.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
    solution would have been to ignore the leak.&nbsp; Instead, I tried a different design using O-Rings that worked pretty well.&nbsp; That
    valve is described in webpage titled <a href="../AnotherBrakeValve/AnotherBrakeValve.htm">Another
    Shay Brake Valve</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
