            <td valign="top">I must confess that I wasn't anxious
              to start machining the brake parts including:
              <ul>
                <li>33 castings</li>
                <li>24 hangers</li>
                <li>12 levers</li>
                <li>24 clevis</li>
                <li>3 anchors</li>
                <li>6 beams</li>
                <li>12 rods</li>
                <li>~ 60 clevis pins&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Kenneth specifies the finished dimensions of the castings and
              most the other parts.&nbsp; The clevis pins however aren't
              specified.&nbsp; After reviewing the drawings and checking over some old photos from Cass, I decided to take another
              trip to Cass to check out the brakes more carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              (It was a good excuse to get off the leash for a couple
              days.)&nbsp; The major difference&nbsp; found was that the hanger
              dimensions were narrower and thicker than Kenneth specified.&nbsp;
              The photo at right shows that the hangers which are&nbsp; 2&quot;
              wide and 1&quot; thick.&nbsp; The hanger clevis pins are
              1&quot; diameter and use cotter pins at each end. These scale to
              1/8&quot; X 1/4&quot; hangers and 1/8&quot; diameter clevis
              pins.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pins in the levers are similar except that
              they have a head on one end.</p>
              <p>Once I made these design changes I got more interested and the
              fabrication was rewarding.&nbsp;&nbsp; ( My daughter claims that
              men aren't happy unless they put their own stamp on things, like a
              dog with a fire hydrant.)</td>

      <p align="left">The next photo shows the finished brake parts for one

      <p align="left">The following three photos show these parts installed on
      the tender truck.&nbsp; If you look close you'll see that hairpin rather
      than cotter pins are used at the ends of the clevis
      pins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hairpins are convenient during the
      construction process.&nbsp; The hairpins will be replaced with standard
      3/64&quot; diameter cotter pins before the engine is actually run because
      I'm afraid the hairpins may work loose and parts will fall
      off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <td valign="top"><b>Park Brake:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Kenneth's drawings
              show how to link the two main frame trucks to the steam brake
              cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He doesn't show how to link the
              tender truck to the steam cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this I
              looked at the tender brake linkage last fall on a trip to
              Cass.&nbsp; It was a bit confusing so I took some photos to enable
              later recreation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later I found these photos useless
              --- I couldn't understand them.&nbsp; &nbsp;
              <p>Some time later I asked Kenneth how he linked the tender brakes
              to the steam cylinder since no linkage was visible in his
              photos.&nbsp; He explained that there is no linkage on his model;
              he instead uses the tender brakes for a park brake
              function.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said this is very handy on tracks where
              the parking sidings are sloped.&nbsp;&nbsp; I immediately thought
              this was a good idea; virtually all of my track will be
              sloped.&nbsp; Sure seems better than a rope and anchor.</p>
              <p>The middle and upper photos on the right show the lever I made
              to control the tender park brake.&nbsp; The tender frame is upside
              down in these photos.&nbsp; The lever pivot is installed on
              the sloped part of a frame channel which makes the idle
              orientation of the lever to be sloped downward.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              strap holds the lever up and roughly level.&nbsp;&nbsp; The slot milled
              toward the front of the strap is the brake engaged
              position.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the lever is in the forward position
              the downward force on the lever holds the lever in the
              slot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The lower photo shows the frame correct side up and the park
              brake lever connected.&nbsp; The lever is positioned in the
              &quot;brakes off&quot; in the photo.&nbsp; The lever seems to have
              enough friction to hold it in the released position.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              If this loosens up&nbsp; I'll add a spring between the lever and
              the bolster to hold the brakes off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Note: I later modified the park brake lever and rear truck
              linkage as the rear truck brakes were connected to the steam brake
              cylinder.&nbsp; &nbsp; </td>

              <td vAlign="top"><b>Clevis Pins:&nbsp; </b>There are 50 or 60
                clevis pins required for the three trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nasty
                job is cross drilling the rods for the cotter pins.&nbsp; The
                jig shown on the right made the job a lot easier.&nbsp; The jig
                is made from brass hex stock.&nbsp; Steel hex stock would have
                been better but I didn't have any.&nbsp;&nbsp; Square stock
                could have also been used but hex can be easily mounted in the
                3-jaw lathe chuck to center drill the jig.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a
                hanger clevis pin being drilled in the photo. The right hole was
                drilled first and the Allen wrench inserted in the hole to hold
                the pin in position.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the left hole was drilled
                the jig was used to hold the rod while the excess length was
                sawed off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              <td>This photo show drilling the single hole in a lever clevis
                pin.&nbsp; Note the multiple holes in the jig.&nbsp; The holes
                tend to enlarge with use and can be used to drill only about 20
                holes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The jig was also used to hold the pin when
                the little tip was ground off the head and the head finished
                with a fine file.
                <p>Note: If I had it to do over I'd probably purchase the
                clevises from Clippard.&nbsp; You can check out their products

                The&nbsp; RC-0881 looks very similar to Ken's drawings and the
                smaller RC-0581 might also be usable,&nbsp; Note that they come
                with the pins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
