    <p>After finishing the steam brake cylinder I was in Kosova for a
    month.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got to
    thinking about the brake linkages on the long flights.&nbsp; The initial plan was to link the
    steam brake to the front and middle truck and use the rear truck for only a
    park brake.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I had made the rear
    part of the cylinder twice the cross sectional area of the front part because I liked the
    look of the cylinder on Cass No. 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most the weight will be on the rear truck (the engineer) so
    I decided it'd be a good idea to also connect that truck to the steam brakes.&nbsp;
    It wouldn't be a problem to combine the park brake and steam brake
    functions on that rear truck ( that's a common practice on autos).&nbsp; However, I couldn't figure out how the
    middle and rear trucks were linked to the rear brake piston on the
    prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp; On
    a previous trip to Cass I had taken photos of these linkages but couldn't figure out the linkage
    configuration from the photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Besides the brake linkage I also wanted to take photos and measurements
    of the reverse handles and the blowdown valves ----- couldn't find the
    blowdown valves on any of the photos I'd taken previously.&nbsp;&nbsp; That
    was enough of an excuse to make another trip to Cass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Upon arrival in Cass I wanted to check out Cass 5 first but it was on a run up the mountain so
    I checked out the linkages on Cass No 10 --- a yet to be restored Class C
    that is a close match to my shay.&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked the reverse handle
    arrangement and will copy it very closely.&nbsp; Found the blowdown
    valve ---- in the mud ring in the middle of the back side --- no wonder I
    didn't have photos of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't like the brake linkages on
    Cass 10 because the arrangement on the trucks were different than Kenneth's
    design that I'd already built.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <td><b>Cass 10 Brakes:&nbsp; </b>I've included this photo of the
            brakes on Cass 10 as a comparison to Kenneth's design.&nbsp; There
            are two identical brake levers, one on each side of the spring
            planks&nbsp; connected by links between the spring planks. The
            connecting links serve as the lever pivots and are free to slide to
            front and rear as necessary to equalize the braking force on the two
            axels.&nbsp; There is a link from the bottom of the levers to the
            brake beams.&nbsp; The top of the inside lever is linked to the
            operating lever, which connects to the steam cylinder.&nbsp; The top
            of the outside lever pushes against the pivot block, which serves as
            a stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a design improvement over the earlier
            version that Kenneth used since fewer parts are required.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    <p><b>Cass 5 Brakes: </b>&nbsp;I was relieved when I was able to examine Cass No 5 later in the
    day; the arrangements on the trucks is identical to Kenneth's
    drawings.&nbsp; After studying the linkage to the rear truck I realized why
    I couldn't understand my previous photos --- they were photos of at least two different
    arrangements on different locomotives --- sort of apples and
    oranges.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time I made a sketch first and then took photos to
    back up the sketch.</p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="BrakeLeverDiagram.jpg" width="710" height="345">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I made up the names for the levers that might disagree with the names
    on some Lima documentation you may have.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please don't get
    upset.&nbsp; Instead, send me a copy and I'll fix up my sketch.&nbsp; The
    front linkage in the sketch is identical to that shown on Kenneth's&nbsp;
    Drawing 32-2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle operating lever is the mirror
    image of the front operating lever.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a short balancing
    lever just ahead of the pivot block of the middle truck to equalize the
    forces applied to the middle and rear trucks.&nbsp; The rear operating lever
    is at the very rear of the main frame with the link to the rear truck
    passing under the middle of coupling between the main frame and the tender
    frame.&nbsp; The position of the lever at the rear and the link under the
    middle of the coupling is to minimize the effects of curved track on the
    link adjustment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;The next photo shows the underside of the front brake
    linkage.&nbsp; This exactly matches Kenneth's Drawing 32-2.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This next photo is a closer view of the linkage between the middle and
    rear truck. The link connecting the balancing lever and the rear operating
    lever is retained and supported by two U shaped brackets screwed to the
    center truck bolster.&nbsp;&nbsp; The link in turn supports the balancing
    and rear operating levers.&nbsp; A similar bracket is screwed to the park
    brake lever.&nbsp; The rod to the rear truck is free to slide through this
    bracket when the steam brakes are applied.&nbsp; When the park brake lever
    is pushed forward it pushes against the pair of nuts which in turn applies
    the brake to the rear brakes.&nbsp; The two nuts are the park brake
    adjustment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Rear2.JPG" width="604" height="333"></p>
     
    <p>There is very little clearance between the frame and the top cross bars
    of the middle truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; The link that passes under the coupling
    between the two frames is fabricated from 1/8&quot; X 1/4&quot; bar
    stock.&nbsp; The front is heated and bent into a loop&nbsp; with&nbsp; a
    rounded front edge to minimize the possibility&nbsp; that it will catch on
    the truck top cross bars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            shows a much smaller clevis.&nbsp; For the steam cylinder clevis I
