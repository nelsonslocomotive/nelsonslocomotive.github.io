    Steam Brake Valve</a><b><font size="5">
    </font></b><font size="3">because the passages were too
    small.&nbsp; The valve worked OK on compressed air but sometimes would not
    pass steam, especially under lower pressure such as less than 50
    psi.&nbsp;&nbsp; I modified the the valve by drilling the passages
    larger.&nbsp; This fixed the blockage problem but the clearances were
    reduced with the larger passages and the valve developed a small
    leak.&nbsp;&nbsp; One solution was to make a new valve designed with larger
    passages.&nbsp; A valve with 3/32&quot; passages would be satisfactory and
    this size passage could probably be achieved reliably with a 3/8&quot; valve
    plug.&nbsp;</font></p>
     
    <p align=left>I had recently finished building an air compressor/pump that
    used O-Ring seals and was very happy with the O-Rings.&nbsp; I had also made
    a blowdown valve using an O-Ring seal and was happy with that design.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    With these successes I decided to try to make a brake valve using
    O-Rings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The O-rings will seal against a rotating disk
    just like the blowdown valve.&nbsp; Recall that the valve must make two
    connections at once: the steam input to one end of the cylinder and the
    other end of the cylinder to the exhaust.&nbsp;&nbsp; The passages
    connecting&nbsp; the between valve inputs and outputs will be within the
    rotating disk.&nbsp; (This was the view in January 2004).</p>
     
    <p align=left><b>Update 2/26/2006: </b>&nbsp;I made the O-Ring valve and it worked 
    fine for a few weeks and then started to leak after one of the O-Rings tore 
    on the disk.&nbsp;&nbsp; I replaced the O-Ring and then another tore in a 
    week or so.&nbsp;&nbsp; It turned out this design didn't work very 
    well.&nbsp;&nbsp;After two summers with seldom working brakes I decided to design a new valve using a rotating 
    disk on a thin sheet of Teflon.&nbsp; The disk is spring loaded and the 
    entire valve is pressurized and sealed.&nbsp; This valve uses some of the 
    concepts of a brake valve sold by LocoParts.&nbsp; The LocoParts valve is an 
    excellent value and I recommend it.&nbsp; Unfortunately that valve controls 
    only one end of the brake cylinder and is not applicable to the double ended 
    cylinders used on the early Shays.&nbsp;&nbsp; I deleted the description of 
    the O-Ring based valve from this page and replaced it with the description of the 
    disk-Teflon seal valve which really works.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

          <td><b>Brake Valve Base:&nbsp;</b> The drawing on right shows the valve base.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          The base is made of 1.375&quot; diameter brass rod.&nbsp; The nine outer 
          holes tapped 3-48 are for attaching the top to the base.&nbsp; I 
          drilled the holes in the top first and then used the top as a pattern 
          to drill the holes in the base.&nbsp; Steam enters the base through 
          the 3/16&quot; MTP hole in the back and then up through a tension pin 
          forced into the 3/16&quot; vertical hole.&nbsp; The center 3/16&quot; hole is 
          for the shaft.&nbsp; The three&nbsp; 3/32 holes near the front are the 
          steam ports. &nbsp; 
          The middle port is for exhaust and goes out the bottom.&nbsp; The 
          other two ports intersect 3/16&quot; MTP holes out the front that go to 
          each end of the brake cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

          cylinder allowing that end to exhaust.&nbsp; One of the holes though
