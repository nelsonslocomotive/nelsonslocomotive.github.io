      <p align=left><font size="3">There are two major components
      to the steam brake system, the cylinder/pistons and the valve.&nbsp; The
      cylinder/pistons are fairly straightforward and described here.&nbsp; The brake valve is a more than
      a simple on/off -- it's usually three position --- &quot;brakes off&quot;,
      where the cylinder is vented to the outside, &quot;brakes on&quot; where
      steam is applied to the cylinder and &quot;brakes hold&quot;, where both
      the steam supply and vent are closed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is to postpone
      making the brake valve and instead initially implement the function with a
      couple globe valves.</font></p>
    <p align=left>Kenneth provides a drawing for the steam cylinder but it
    didn't seem to match my recollection of the steam brake cylinders I'd seen at
    Cass.&nbsp; As I recalled, the back portion was bigger diameter, since it
    applies the brakes to both the middle and rear trucks.&nbsp; Before making
    the trip to Cass in the spring of 2003 I checked some photos of Cass No 5
    taken in the fall of 2002.&nbsp; The photo below shows that the cylinder is
    the same size front and rear (so much for my recollection of the two ends
    being different sizes), but the rear portion is set a couple of inches
    lower.&nbsp; Also, the total cylinder is about 1/3 longer than Kenneth
    specifies&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Cass5_2002.jpg" align="right" width="700" height="357"></p>

    <p align=center><img border="0" src="Cass10_2003.JPG" width="700" height="336" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>In the spring of 2003 I looked at Cass 10 first, a yet to be
    restored Shay that is bare bones with the brake hardware exposed as shown
    above. The brake cylinder is one piece uniform diameter
    rather than the two pieces as on Cass 5 shown earlier.&nbsp; It's also shorter
    than the cylinder on Cass 5 --- in fact, it's a pretty good match for Kenneth's
    specification.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was curious why the uniform diameter
    since the rear part should do double duty --- the middle and rear
    trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon closer inspection (crawling underneath) it
    was discovered the middle and rear trucks aren't linked.&nbsp; Further,
    there are air brake units connected to all three trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp; So,
    Cass 10 had steam brakes on the front and middle trucks and air brakes on all
    three trucks.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>Then it was on to Cass 5 since I was pretty sure that the
    middle and rear trucks are linked.&nbsp; The trucks are indeed linked.&nbsp;
    Also, the cylinder was changed between the fall of 2002 and spring of 2003.
    And no, the pictures aren't of some other locomotive --- I have photos that
    include both the brake cylinder and the number on the side of the cab&nbsp;
    for both 2002 and 2003.&nbsp; They&nbsp; changed the cylinder over the
    winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rear part of the new cylinder&nbsp; is much bigger
    diameter as shown in the following two photos.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=center>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Cass5_2003A.JPG" width="700" height="365">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>Isn't it neat to see the steam?</p>
    <p align=center><img border="0" src="Cass5_2003B.jpg" width="699" height="389"></p>
    <p align=left>So, which should I model?&nbsp;&nbsp;The cylinder above with
    the two different outside diameters seems more interesting so I decided to
    go with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that I don't link the middle and rear truck
    brakes; I use the rear truck for the park brake.&nbsp; That would suggest
    the pistons should be the same size.&nbsp; However, to get near scale dimensions
    I want to cut the forward piston from 3/4&quot; diameter of Kenneth's
    specification to 5/8&quot; diameter.&nbsp; This of course reduces the
    braking force.&nbsp; To compensate, I'll make the rear piston
    7/8&quot;.&nbsp; One rationalization&nbsp; for this is that the rear truck
    will have greater weight since it carries part of the engineer's weight so
    it can stand a bit more braking force.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the middle truck locks
    up too easily, I'll have to connect the rear truck --- maybe a project for
    the future.</p>

          <td><b>Machining Cylinders:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; Machining the cylinders
            was straightforward.&nbsp; The tricky part is to shape the heads and
            glands and to layout the head bolt patterns.&nbsp; Years ago I made
            a fixture to mount the lathe chucks to the rotary table.&nbsp; I
            used that fixture as shown on the right to shape the glands and
            mating surface of the heads.&nbsp; After shaping the glands I replaced the end mill with a
            center drill, got everything aligned properly and&nbsp;marked the first bolt
            hole with the center drill.&nbsp; I then rotated the
            table 60 degrees to each new bolt location.&nbsp; This was repeated
            for the other head.&nbsp; I also made a drilling
            fixture similar to a head for the bolt pattern between the two cylinders and marked
            the pattern on the fixture using this same
            setup.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            flange.&nbsp; The head and gland flanges are 0.125&quot; wide.&nbsp;&nbsp; The

            screws.<p>The inner end of the smaller half of the cylinder was left partially closed as shown on

    <p>This shows the brake cylinder clamped in position; a close match to the
    cylinder on Cass No. 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
     
    <p>Have to put the up the Shay project for a while as I do something else.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Hopefully the boiler will arrive and be ready when I get back to the
    project in a month or so.&nbsp;</p>
     
    <p><b>Update 12/14/03:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Since this page
    was first done several brake valves have been made and the brake system
    tested on both compressed air and steam.&nbsp; The following changes were
    made after these tests:</p>
     
    <ul>
      <li>The tender brakes were linked to the middle truck brakes so that all
        three trucks have steam brakes&nbsp; like Cass No 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
        linkage is show on<a href="../BrakeLinks/BrakeLinks.htm"> Brake Links</a>
        page.<br>
        &nbsp;</li>
      <li>The vent hole in the center was threaded 3/16&quot;
        MTP to implement the brake backoff function (see <a href="../BrakeValve/BrakeValve.htm">brake
        valve</a> page for description of backoff).&nbsp; The photos of the Cass
        5 cylinder show the pipe&nbsp; connection to this hole.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The #2 screws were replaced with #2 studs (screws
        with heads cut off).<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The clearances between the&nbsp; piston and
        cylinder and the stem and the packing gland were increased to make sure
        there is no binding.&nbsp; The stem is very long and it is difficult to align
        the brake levers perfectly.&nbsp; The final cylinder and stem clearances
        are ~0.015.&nbsp; The fit is sloppy but the O-Rings easily take up any
        slack.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>While the boiler pressure maxes out at 100 psi, the
        pressure is not always at max and we want the cylinder friction forces
        to be small compared to the operation forces.&nbsp; To this end, the
        unloaded piston was tested on about 20 psi air and adjusted so that it
        moved easily.&nbsp;&nbsp; The O-Ring gland depth is normally made so
        that there is&nbsp; 0.010&quot; to 0.018&quot; squeeze of the O-Ring
        (see Macro Rubber Website&nbsp; <a href="http://www.marcorubber.com/glands_dynamic_reciprocating.htm">http://www.marcorubber.com/glands_dynamic_reciprocating.htm</a>).&nbsp;
        This amount of squeeze resulted in too much
        friction so the gland depth was increased to make the squeeze about
        0.005&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The piston moved much smoother and there didn't
        seem to be any leaks.&nbsp;<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
     
    <p>The&nbsp; Macro Rubber website (<a href="http://www.marcorubber.com/index.htm">http://www.marcorubber.com/index.htm</a>)
    has a nice compatibility chart for O-Rings.&nbsp;&nbsp; They list EPDM as <b>&quot;recommended&quot;</b>
    for steam at 300 degrees or less but <b>&quot;not recommended&quot;&nbsp;</b>
    for steam over 300 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; The temperature of the 100 psi steam
    in the boiler is 337 degrees.&nbsp; This will be cooled somewhat when it
    gets to the cylinder, assuming it's actually 100 psi in the boiler.&nbsp;
    Also, there's probably a little margin in the upper limit, so we should be
    safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
     
    <p>McMaster-Carr carries two different types of EPDM O-Rings.&nbsp; The
    following is the McMaster description of the one I choose: <i><nobr><a href="http://www.mcmaster.com/param/asp/psearch.asp?FAM=orings&amp;FT_158=8427&amp;session=orings;158=8427">NSF-Approved
    Ethylene Propylene (EPDM)</a>:</nobr> <span class="featurevalcopy">Perfect
    for water transmission systems, this ethylene propylene (EPDM) meets
    ANSI/NSF Standard 61, which limits the amounts of chemicals permitted to
    leach into drinking water. It has excellent chloramines and compression-set
    resistance. Also meets FDA requirements for repeated use in food handling.
    Durometer is Shore A: 70; temperature range is -40° to +300°F.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span></i><span class="featurevalcopy">The EPDM is not compatible with petroleum
    products so don't use any grease to lubricate the cylinder ---- the O-Ring
    will swell and get sticky (experience speaking).&nbsp; The condensate water is a satisfactory
    lubricant.&nbsp; If a lubricant is needed to get the piston in the cylinder,
    one could use soap or animal fat (butter) or vegetable oil (olive oil, corn
    oil, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp; McMaster-Carr sells the sizes used for the cylinder
    for in packages of 25 for about $5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
