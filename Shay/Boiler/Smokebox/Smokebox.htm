      <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">The machining of&nbsp; the smoke
      box related castings and fabrication of the smoke box fittings were done
      while waiting for the boiler to arrive. &nbsp; The smoke box castings are the smokestack, smokestack base,
      smoke box front and smoke box door.&nbsp; The other smoke box fittings
      fabricated from stock are the petticoat, the blower and the engine exhaust
      fittings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

            bolts between the smokestack and the base.&nbsp; Maybe Kenneth has
            the right idea since it appears only four nuts were used on Cass 10.</td>

            The first step was to mount the casting in the 4- jaw chuck and
            center the points between the little smokestack attachment
            bosses.&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper surface was then turned to the correct
            height and the inside drilled and bored.&nbsp;&nbsp; The chuck was
            then transferred to the rotary table and the 4 smokestack attachment
            holes and the 6 base attachment holes marked with a center drill as
            shown on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            bar/ fly cutter type tool in the mill.&nbsp; Friend Dan Staron said
            he used a fly cutter.&nbsp;
            <p>A holder for a boring bore as shown on the right was made and
            mounted in the mill.&nbsp;&nbsp; The base was mounted in the milling vise with
            the finished side resting on a couple parallel spacers. The
            vise and milling head were oriented such that the axis of the cut
            was centered over the front and back mounting holes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            This turned out to be easy to setup.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The little Maximat V10 mill head originally had four speeds but
            only two were working so care was take to make very small cuts on
            the slowest speed&nbsp; --- that 3.3&quot; lever produces a lot of
            shock.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the job was about 80% done the last two
            speeds on the mill disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd been thinking that
            the mill was just too light for live steam work

            that the axis of the cut was perpendicular to the base of the
            angle.&nbsp;&nbsp; A centerline was scribed on the base.&nbsp; The
            angle was then mounted to the faceplate on the bench and aligned so
            that the centerline was in line with the center of the faceplate and
            the position of the finished cut in the base would be 3.315&quot;

            this is not a precision cut and an error of a few thousands or more

      back to the zero speed milling head.&nbsp; The gear box was opened and
      three sets of gears found&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each set&nbsp; (shaft) has two
      gears, one steel and one fiber.&nbsp; Only one gear on each shaft is used
      at a time and the arrangement is such that the meshing gears are always
      steel - fiber, never steel-steel or fiber-fiber.&nbsp; The steel-fiber
      interface may be to reduce noise.&nbsp; In any case, it's not a very
      robust design.&nbsp; Two of the the fiber gears were toothless.&nbsp;</i></font></p>
     
    <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>A call to the only know parts
      distributor brought the expected news that replacement parts are no longer
      available.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further study revealed that the damaged gears were
      24 tooth and within a few thousands of&nbsp; 16DP 14.5 degree spur gears.&nbsp;
    Replacements arrived in two days and&nbsp; three hours later
    after boring, cutting off the boss, trimming the width and filing the teeth
    a bit the mill was back online with all four speeds.&nbsp; It's now a bit noisier,
    but these gears were always noisy anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></font></p>
     
    <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>There is one fiber gear
    remaining but it's much larger and probably less likely to
    fail.&nbsp; On further reflection, failure was at least partially due to&nbsp;not
    fully engaging the gears so that the load was carried
    by only part of the width of the teeth.&nbsp; Must be more careful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></font></p>

            the rough casting.&nbsp;
            <p>The thing that worked was to mount the large end on the 4-jaw
            chuck and then adjust the chuck so that surfaces of the hub midway
            between the little tabs (see photo on right) was as close to
            centered as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the inside of the end was
            bored to a depth of about 3/8&quot; using very small cuts.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
            was continued until a smooth surface was obtained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            tailstock center.&nbsp;&nbsp; The setup is shown on the right.&nbsp; Next, the
            4-jaw chuck was adjusted so that the end closest to the chuck was as
            centered as possible --- see photo.
            <p>Once this was done, it was a simple matter to turn the base end
            and then mount the base in the 3-jaw chuck to turn the taper on the
            upper end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Friend Dan Staron had warned me that the outer crust of the
            castings were very tough and hard to machine and it was best to grind the
            surface.&nbsp; That turned out to be the case with the tapered
            part.&nbsp; If one takes an initial cut of 0.020&quot; or more,
            there's not much trouble with the surface.&nbsp; However, very small
            cuts sometimes dulls the tool nearly immediately.&nbsp; The tapered
            part was lightly faced on the bench grinder which cured the tool
            dulling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            filled with 550 degree solder and filed smooth ---- almost like lead
            body work.&nbsp;
            <p>The base was then aligned on the stack and used as a drilling
            fixture to drill the mounting holes in the stack.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            two pieces were joined and an air die grinder used to match the
            ring and tabs on the stack with the mating surfaces on the

          <td><b>Blower &amp; Exhaust:&nbsp;</b> The most difficult part of the
            blower-exhaust system is the flange that attaches to the bottom of
            the smoke box.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kenneth suggests that&nbsp; the flange be
            made from the cutout for the boiler steam dome.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm
            having my boiler built by someone else so I didn't have the
            cutout.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short piece of the 6&quot; schedule 40
            pipe was obtained from the local machine shop.&nbsp; The 0.28&quot;
            thickness seemed excess so I turned the thickness down to about
            3/16&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then drilled a 1/2&quot; hole in the middle
            of what was to be the flange.&nbsp; This was done before cutting out
            the flange to make sure the hole was perpendicular to the
            flange.&nbsp;&nbsp; The flange was then rough cut from the section
            of pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A piece of 1/2&quot; rod was center
            drilled on one end and the other end silver soldered into the
            flange, making sure the rod was perpendicular.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            rod was then chucked in the lathe and the outside turned to
            2.5&quot;<p>The photo shows the piece of pipe and the flange with
            rod after the OD was turned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <td>Next, the flange was chucked in the 4-jaw chuck.&nbsp; The end of
            the rod centered with the tailstock center and the chuck adjusted
            so that the rod close to the flange was also centered.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The chuck was then tightened&nbsp;and the rod cut off next to the flange (hacksaw).&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The flange was then drilled/bored to ~ 0.975&quot; to match with the OD of&nbsp; a
            3/4&quot; copper elbow.</td>

          <td>These are the components of the exhaust and blower system.&nbsp; The brass blower ring and exhaust were machined as per Kenneth's
            drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The flange hole positions were changed from
            the drawing;&nbsp; the two&nbsp; mounting holes closest to the
            exhaust pipe were located away from the equal spacing position
            slightly to give easier access to the screw heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Update5/14/04:</b>
            <font face="Arial" size="3">Kenneth had specified four 1/32&quot;
            (0.032&quot;) holes for the blower working with his propane burner.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            These holes plugged up several time using my oil burner.&nbsp; Bob
            Reedy's design for his oil burning&nbsp; Three Truck Climax&nbsp;
            (July/August 2003 <u>Live Steam</u> ) uses four #55 drill
            (0.052&quot;) holes. Reedy's design was copied and the blower holes
            were enlarged to 0.052&quot; which fixed the problem&nbsp;<b> End

            that held the smoke box door closed--- they seemed too large and way
            out of scale.&nbsp; I replaced the clips with cast brass dogs from <a href="http://www.livesteam.com/">Railroad
            Warehouse</a> (the smaller dogs, part # DOG-01).&nbsp; The photo on
            right shows the installed dogs on the freshly powder coated smoke
            box front and door.&nbsp;&nbsp; The four shiny screws hold the front
            to the smoke box --- these screws will be painted black at some
            point.&nbsp; The powder coating sealed the door to the front casting
            --- there are no plans to open the door; smoke box access is by
            removing the door and front castings as a unit.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
