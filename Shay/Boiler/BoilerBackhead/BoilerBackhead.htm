      <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">The machining of&nbsp; the various boiler related castings was
      started and some of the boiler fittings&nbsp; fabricated while waiting for the boiler to
      arrive. &nbsp; The fittings for the backhead are the water
      gauge,&nbsp; the firebox door and the throttle lever.&nbsp;&nbsp;A water gauge
      had already been purchased from Coles so the only water gauge question was
      the best location for the lower
      connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; The firebox door castings had been purchased from
      Kenneth so all that was required there was some minor machining.&nbsp; The
      challenge was to fabricate a lever that resembled a real shay throttle
      lever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
     
      <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">The shay throttle lever is
      similar to other throttles in that a toothed sector
      plate and paw on the lever are used to hold the throttle position.&nbsp;
      On some locomotives&nbsp; the sector plate is held stationary
      similar to the reversing gear lever (see <a href="../../Engine/ReversingGear/ReversingGear.htm">Reversing
      Gear page</a>).&nbsp; However, on the shay throttle lever, the sector plate is part
      of the throttle rod head and moves with the throttle rod ---- to the rear
      and the front as the throttle is opened and closed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next
      photo shows this arrangement on Cass No 5.</font></p>
     
      <p align=center><img border="0" src="Cass5ThrottleA.JPG" width="700" height="388"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
     
      <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">The throttle lever is the slightly
      inclined long bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two brake valves,
      steam on the left and air on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; The top of the reverse
      gear lever is between the two brake valves.</font></p>
    <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">The next photo, also of Cass No 5
    shows a close up of the throttle rod head with sector plate and the pivot link
    to the left of the head.&nbsp; The head and rod have a matched taper fit
    that is held by a taper pin.&nbsp;
    The lever rotates around a pivot pin in the head.&nbsp; The link straps
    pivot at both ends so that they can rotate in the same plane as the
    lever.&nbsp; Note the tape measure from the end of the throttle lever ~ 44
    inches to the pivot point at the rod head.</font></p>

      <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">This next graphic is&nbsp; part
      of a Lima Throttle Lever Drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="LimaDrawing.gif" width="720" height="455"></font></p>
      <p align=left>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">The last piece of data is that
      the throttle valve specified by Kenneth is a common ball valve that rotates 90 degrees and has
      a one-inch lever handle that connects to the throttle rod.&nbsp; The rod will
      move 1.4&quot; to rotate the valve handle 90 degrees.&nbsp; From the drawing
      above one can see that the lever rotates about 45
      degrees from off to full throttle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This leads to the
      first conclusion --- the&nbsp; distance between the rod head pin and the
      link pin&nbsp; on the throttle lever must be 2 inches (twice the valve
      lever length) to make the throttle lever rotate 45 degrees (from off to
      maximum throttle) as the valve handle rotates 90 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align=left>The next step was to cut a cardboard lever and try various
      sector radii.&nbsp;&nbsp; The radius on the drawing above is
      3.95&quot; that would scale to 1/2&quot;.&nbsp; That radius is just too
      small to have a reasonable number of usable teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on
      the teeth from the reversing lever (0.64&quot; wide and 0.070&quot; long)
      it looked like 0.032&quot; wide teeth 0.040&quot; long were doable and
      should be usable and a 1.5&quot; radius would not look
      too out of scale.&nbsp; A bit of calculation yields 3.5 degrees per tooth for
      cutting teeth using a 0.032&quot; slitting saw on a 1.5&quot; radius disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The part with the teeth was cut from a
            1.5&quot; radius disk. The teeth were cut with a slitting saw.&nbsp;
            A rotary table was used to do the indexing similar to the tooth
            cutting on the reverse lever sector plate.&nbsp; The other piece was
            milled from bar stock and then drilled and taped 10-32 to accept the throttle rod.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            two pieces were joined with a 2-56 screw, silver soldered and then
            the screw head filed off.&nbsp;</td>

          <td>This shows a mockup of the backhead.&nbsp; There is no
            interference between the water gauge and the longer left end of the
            throttle lever.&nbsp; The lever worked smooth and readily achieved
            the 1.4&quot; throttle rod motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right side of the
            lever is 5&quot;, a bit shorter than Cass No 5 (44 inches scales to
            5.5&quot;) and pointed up at a greater angle to give enough room to
            operate the reverse lever under the throttle lever.&nbsp; (The
            problem is fat fingers --- the engineer's hands are not to 1/8th
            scale.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <p>The next step was to make a trigger-paw arrangement and then trim

            easier to hold the part in the milling vise.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next
            step was to file a radius on the ends beside the holes for the

    <p>This next photo shows completed parts of the throttle lever.&nbsp;
    The pivot point on the upper left is made from 5/16&quot; hex brass and threaded
    1/16&quot; NPT (5/16&quot; MTP).&nbsp; The little links are 1/16&quot; thick
    steel plate.&nbsp; The throttle rod gland is made from a 3/16&quot;
    compression to 1/4&quot; NPT brass fitting.&nbsp; The compression part was
    cut off and a solid brass rod was silver solder into the 1/4&quot; NPT
    side.&nbsp; The inside was then drilled #12 as specified by Kenneth.&nbsp;
    The packing area was drilled 5/16&quot; with an allowance for 1/8&quot;
    thick packing.&nbsp; The little white piece is a Teflon packing piece.&nbsp;
    If that doesn't work, O-Rings will be the next
    option.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little disk rather than a nut is used to
    compress the packing, matching the prototype.&nbsp; The studs are 2-56
    stainless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p><img border="0" src="Parts.jpg" width="699" height="363"></p>
    <p>The three partially threaded screws are 5-40 made from 3/16&quot; hex
    stainless stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will be retained with locking nuts.&nbsp;
    The photo shows the underside of the rod head, lever&nbsp; and paw. The paw is attached to the lifting block by a couple 1-72 button head
    screws.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lifting rod is 1/16&quot; brass threaded&nbsp;
    0-80 on each end. The pivot on the&nbsp; trigger are more of the 1-72
    button head screws as are the screws in the spring retaining
    block.&nbsp;&nbsp; The spring is out of the scrap box and too large
    diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 1/8&quot; OD spring will be secured on the next
    McMaster order.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    lever.&nbsp;&nbsp; It works slick!</p>
