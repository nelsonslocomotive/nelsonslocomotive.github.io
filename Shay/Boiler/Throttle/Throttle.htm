    <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">When I contacted for the boiler,
    the boiler maker said the throttle was very difficult to install and
    volunteered to install the throttle for an additional $250.&nbsp;&nbsp; That
    of course was a challenge, and since the the parts cost about $10, I decided
    to do it myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the thoughts was that if I did it myself
    I would know how to get at it for any necessary maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Turns
    out that it takes an hour or two to make the parts and a few minutes to
    install them if one doesn't do anything
    stupid.&nbsp; Of course, I did something stupid, so it took a bit
    longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">The throttle is </font>a common
    1/4&quot; pipe brass ball valve (brass body/stainless steel ball) located in
    the steam dome.&nbsp; The valve is controlled by a rod that connects between
    a lever on the valve and the throttle lever on the boiler
    backhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            best choice might be a stainless hairpin type cotter.&nbsp; I didn't
            have one of an appropriate size and only non stainless pins are
            available locally.&nbsp; I ended up making the pin from 1/16&quot;
            brass as shown on the right.&nbsp; The top loop is silver
            soldered.&nbsp; The hole in the shaft is 3/32 so the pin slides
            in easily.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used the hooked wire to drop the pin in
            place.&nbsp; A glop of Permatex sealer around the hook in the wire stiffened things up for the installation.</td>

    <p><b>Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!&nbsp; </b>At this point I felt pretty proud;&nbsp;
    installing the
    throttle is no big deal.&nbsp; I then tried to install the two screws&nbsp;
    ---- very hard to turn and could only get them in a turn or two.&nbsp;
    Darn!&nbsp; Figured the holes on the throttle assembly weren't the same
    spacing as in the support causing the screws to bind.&nbsp;&nbsp; The holes in the assembly
    were slightly oversized, but maybe not enough.&nbsp; No problem, take it back
    out.&nbsp; The cotter pin was pulled using a stiff wire with a hook on the
    end.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tip of a screw driver was then used to push the rod out of the lever.&nbsp;
    When doing this I thought that maybe the front of the rod should be secured
    so that it doesn't fall into the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than a microsecond
    later the rod popped of the lever and slid into the bottom of the
    boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; GRRRRRRR!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The lever is stainless so it could have been left in the boiler.&nbsp; However
    there is the pride factor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting it out looked impossible ----
    the boiler is crossed with the tubes and there is a flat stay plate beside
    the hole in the backhead.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, the only way to get it out is
    through that hole in the backhead.</p>
    <p>Turns out that it came out fairly easily --- this time I thought before
    acting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned&nbsp; the boiler upside down and found that the
    rod fell to the bottom --- on top the steam dome hole.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
    able to loop a wire over the rod.&nbsp; Then turned the boiler right side
    and pushed the rod as far as it would go to the front&nbsp; --- the back end
    of the rod was at the rear side of the dome opening.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then
    slipped a length of 3/8&quot; OD copper tubing into the gland hole in the
    backhead and then pushed it into the boiler and worked it over the end of
    the rod.&nbsp; The only problem with this was that the the tubing was
    restricted by the stay plates.&nbsp; However, a couple minutes later the end
    of the rod was in the tube. The tube was then pushed to the front of the
    boiler forcing the entire straight part of the rod in the tube.&nbsp; The
    tube was then withdrawn with the the rod inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;I had mixed emotions about about including this whole episode ---
    however it might be useful as encouragement to other mechanically challenged
    steamers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b>Those screw holes:&nbsp; </b>Before enlarging the screw holes in
    the throttle assembly, screws were tried in the threaded holes in the
    throttle support.&nbsp; They would only go in a turn or two.&nbsp; The
    inside of the boiler is pretty rusted.&nbsp; The boiler was soaked in
    pickling solution before the silver soldering.&nbsp; This left a clear
    surface that oxidizes quickly ---- and the boiler had set around for months
    after it was made.&nbsp; So, it was likely rust in the threads&nbsp; ----
    all the was needed was to run&nbsp; a tap through the holes.&nbsp; Fat
    chance --- no way could I get a tap in the steam dome.&nbsp; Then remembered
    that those black machine screws are really hard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ground a couple
    tapered flats near the end of a screw making&nbsp; a poor-man's tap.&nbsp; A
    large T- handle hex wrench and and a few drops of tapping fluid cleaned the
    threads.&nbsp; Actually did it twice with two different screws to
    get them really clean.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
