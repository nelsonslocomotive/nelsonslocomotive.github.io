    <p align=left>The boiler was fabricated by a professional as discussed
    elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was supplied with the major cutouts in the smoke
    box for the smokestack and exhaust but without mounting screw holes, water
    feed holes and the various holes in the backhead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drilling these
    holes was
    approached carefully because mistakes might be difficult to
    repair. The first thing done on the boiler was to install the
    throttle valve as described in the Throttle page.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was then
    decided to finish drilling all the remaining holes ---- it's too hard to repeatedly
    remove the boiler to drill a hole.&nbsp; The mountings/supports were
    finished and then all the holes for the plumbing
    and other functional fittings were drilled.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cosmetic fittings including lagging, jacket, handrail, etc
    were deferred until after the locomotive has been fully tested. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            side of the boiler will probably be covered with lagging and the
            boiler jacket.&nbsp; The bottom of the angle is at the same height as the
            running boards.&nbsp; I will probably make a clamp that
            resembles the angles in the previous photo to fit over and hold down

            of the firebox.&nbsp; The boiler was placed upside down on the workbench

            box front didn't fit properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; My smoke box was also out
            of round by about 1/16&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was fixed by
            squeezing the front of the smoke box in a 10 ton press. (Those of
            you that have been to an IRS office might recognize the press; they use
            same kind.) Once the front was made round, the boiler was placed
            with the backhead&nbsp; on the floor and the 4 holes for the smoke
            box front studs drilled with a hand
            drill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            drill press as shown in photo on right.&nbsp; The studs to retain
            the smoke box front can also be seen in the photo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <p><b>Water Feed Holes: </b>The water feed holes each side of the
            boiler were also drilled with the drill press.&nbsp; Care was taken

            right.&nbsp;
            <p>.<b>Water Gauge: </b>The hole was then drilled for the lower end
            of the water gauge.&nbsp; The hole was positioned so that the bottom of the
            visible part of the glass is 3/4&quot; above the crown
            sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            is for the throttle pivot.&nbsp; Before making that hole, the
            boiler was placed on the frame as shown on the right.&nbsp; The
            brass rod on top the boiler is meant to simulate the steam turret. &nbsp; The steam brake valve mounts on the ledge over the
            rear cylinder.&nbsp; The brake handle will be above the top of the
            reverse lever and below the throttle&nbsp;
            lever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This mockup helped in picking a good
            angle for the throttle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            completed so it was a good time to make the rear boiler
            clamps.&nbsp; The boiler jacket will be supported by 1/4&quot;
            square rod spacers tack welded to the boiler. The spacers adjacent
            to the front of the cab and on the sides over the rear boiler mount angles were tacked in place first.&nbsp; The clamps were
            then fitted over the rear mount angles and against the jacket
            spacers and holes drilled through the clamp, walkway and the flange of the
            frame I beam. The holes in the I beam flange were tapped 4-40 and
            the holes through the clamp and walkway were enlarged to #4
            clearance (#33 drill).&nbsp;&nbsp;
