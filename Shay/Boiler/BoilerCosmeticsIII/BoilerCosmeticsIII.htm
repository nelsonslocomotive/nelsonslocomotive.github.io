              <p>The first step was to chuck the dome and rough bore the

              smoothed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The light colored specks are dust.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
              however numerous small pits still visible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are

              Neither the body filler nor the putty is compatible with powder
              coating.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've since learned that there is a metallic
              filler that will work with powder coating.&nbsp; I'll order a
              can and if the pits still bother me in a few weeks I'll strip
              the dome, fill the pits and then powder coat it again.&nbsp; (The

              1/2&quot; bolt that runs from a large washer inside the dome,
              through the vise jaws and through a large washer on the bottom
              side of the jaws.&nbsp; The jaws were also tightened on the bolt
              to hold it steady.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

              helps.&nbsp; After the base was about 50% machined it was
              removed&nbsp; and tested on the boiler.&nbsp; The angle was
              increased slightly and the job then finished.

              bevel gears about a year ago and a 5/8&quot; rod.&nbsp; The two
              pieces were silver solder together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>A 13/64&quot; hole was dilled on each side of the dome near the bottom for
              3/16&quot; diameter sand pipes that run down the side of the
              boiler to the truck. &nbsp;The pipe will slide into the

              to slide around so the alignment&nbsp; fixture shown in the photo
              was made.&nbsp;&nbsp; The threaded rod is 1/4&quot;-20 that goes
              into the spacer that was welded to the boiler&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              There is a short length of 1&quot; diameter aluminum rod under the
              rectangular piece of aluminum.&nbsp; The bottom of the rod was
              machined to the correct radius and slope using the same setup
              as for the bottom of the dome.&nbsp; The rectangular piece was
              pinned to the rod to keep it from rotating and both pieces held
              against the top of the boiler with the nut and washer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The four holes for the bolts were tapped
              1/4&quot;-28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bolts were&nbsp; adjusted to
