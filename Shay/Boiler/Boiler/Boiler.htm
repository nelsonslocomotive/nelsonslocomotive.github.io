    <p align=left>Early in the project I decided to contract the boiler
    fabrication to a professional.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was primarily because
    of limited welding skills and safety concerns.&nbsp; The boiler was ordered
    in early January with a promised delivery in the late April - early May
    timeframe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately there were many delays.&nbsp; The
    boiler was finally finished in mid September but not shipped until early
    November, arriving on November 11.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to keep the
    project going by completing essentially everything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    However, this was less than efficient in many cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>It's not surprising that several folks have inquired about who made the
    boiler and how much it cost;&nbsp; I had the same questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This area is probably changing as many states are increasing
    regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following information is general in nature to give one
    some idea of
    boiler costs and options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The boiler described above was purchased from Ed Perry of Fresno
    California.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The quality seems excellent.&nbsp; (Ed is well
    known and has an excellent reputation.) &nbsp; A few days
    after the boiler arrived Ed sent copies of metallurgical test reports on
    the material used and a certificate that he had tested the boiler to 450
    psi.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only complaint I had was that delivery was promised and
    then delayed many times.&nbsp; This was in part due to some health problems
    Ed had.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost was $2200 for the boiler, $50 extra for the
    plate in the firebox to deflect the flame and $125 UPS shipping from
    California to Ohio.&nbsp; Ed advertises in <u>Live Steam</u></p>
    <p>I had been discussing boilers with Ken Schroeder and he said he had asked
    for information from another boiler maker.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is the
    information Ken emailed to me (November 2003): &quot;<i>Just got a letter from Boschan
    Boiler today and wanted to pass on the information he sent me on the boiler.&nbsp;
    He priced two boilers, one to code&nbsp;and the other non-code, the only
    difference is steel tubes for the code boiler and copper tubes&nbsp;in the
    non-code.&nbsp;&nbsp; He will build it as I designed it using the same plate
    thickness I show on the drawings.&nbsp; The price for a code boiler rated
    for 100 psi is $3950.00 and $4625.00 for a boiler rated above 100 psi
    operating pressure.&nbsp; The added cost for a boiler operating over 100 psi
    is because the welds have to be examined using a radiograph.&nbsp; Code
    boilers will be stamped with a ASME Code S stamp and will be provided with
    an ASME P-2, manufacturer's data sheet.&nbsp; Data sheet will be filed with
    the&nbsp;National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors.&nbsp; The
    price for the non-code boiler is $3515.00 which would have copper tubes.&nbsp;
    Prices are FOB Carson California&nbsp;and boilers would be ready 8-10 weeks
    after receiving a 50% deposit with the balance due upon inspection by an
    authorized inspector for the code boiler&nbsp;or after a hydro test of the
    non code boiler.&nbsp; I have not seen Boschan's work.&nbsp; In a subsequent
    conversation Paul Boschan said he rolls the tubes in on both code and non
    code boilers.&nbsp; If someone wants&nbsp;the copper tubes&nbsp;silver
    soldered in, he can do that also.&nbsp; He will heli-arc steel tubes if the
    customer wants.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Boschan
    advertises in <u>Live Steam.</u></p>

    <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">The next time I'll probably make
    the boiler.&nbsp; The biggest job seems to be cutting out the pieces and
    cutting the bevels on the edges that are welded.&nbsp;&nbsp; One possibility
    is to cut all the pieces, tack weld or screw them together and take them to
    a local welder for the actual welding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align=left>There are two ways to install copper tubes, silver soldering or
    rolling.&nbsp; Silver soldering probably makes the more reliable joint but
    is more difficult to do --- the joints must be really clean for the solder
    to flow properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The soldered joints are probably difficult to
    repair if they start to leak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rolled joints are
    easiest to do once one makes a rolling tool.&nbsp; (Several rolling tool
    have been described Live Steam recently.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The rolled joints are
    probably more likely to leak but are easy to repair by rolling
    again.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rolled tubes
    seems to be the easiest for the novice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
