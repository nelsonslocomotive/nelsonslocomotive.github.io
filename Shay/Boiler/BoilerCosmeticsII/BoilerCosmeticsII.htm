      <p align="left">The plan was to position the boiler on the frame
      and mount the cab before cutting the rear jacket piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      However, when the boiler was positioned it was found that something was
      holding the boiler above the correct position (I knew things were going too
      smoothly).&nbsp; The angles under
      the front jacket piece were against the top of the front truck bolster
      cross channels.&nbsp; That problem was solved by relocating the front
      screw holding the two angles together so that it was between the two
      channels.&nbsp; The part of the angles directly over the channels were
      then cut
      back to eliminate the interference.&nbsp; The next problem was that the
      boiler rested on the new frame cross brace just to the front of the fire
      box.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rats!&nbsp; I forgot that the bottom of the boiler&nbsp;
      jacket is about 1/8&quot; below the top of the frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recess
      was ground in the
      center of the cross brace to eliminate the interference.&nbsp; That
      worked well.&nbsp; The 1.25&quot; high cross brace could have been aligned
      with the bottom of the frame I beams like the truck bolsters to eliminate
      this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I like the brace in the higher position
      where it's more noticeable from the sides.&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left"><b>Bands: </b>Before starting the rear jacket section described above,
      brass strips were ordered for the bands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first
      though was to use 1/4&quot; wide strips.&nbsp; However, review of some
      Cass photos suggested the bands were wider.&nbsp; Measurements of the
      bands on the photos and some calculations indicated the bands are about 2
      inches wide, which would scale to 1/2&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a double check,
      1/2&quot; strips of blue masking tape were put on the model, a photo taken
      and then edited so that the boiler length was the same length as the
      boiler in a photo of Cass 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two photos were overlapped
      and positioned so that a band and a piece of tape lined
      up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is this combined photo.&nbsp; The
      bands indeed should be about 1/2&quot; wide.&nbsp; However, I think the
      tape looks too wide.&nbsp; I ended up ordering 3/8&quot; wide bands and a
      couple pieces of 1/4&quot; and 5/16&quot; in case I want to use a narrower
      band on the front.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bands came from Special Shapes.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
