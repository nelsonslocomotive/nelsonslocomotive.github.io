      <p>I'd been dreading dealing with the exterior of the boiler because sheet
      metal is involved.&nbsp; Also, there is very little in my reference books
      as how to do the jacket.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The goal is to finish enough of the boiler cosmetic details so
      that it can be painted and installed permanently; I'm getting tired of
      tearing the plumbing apart.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; required tasks include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>stripping the paint.</li>
        <li>installing the smoke box rivet detail.</li>
        <li>installing the spacers that support the edges of the jacket</li>
        <li>installing the pads that support the domes, bell, generator and handrail stanchions.</li>
        <li>making&nbsp; the boiler jacket.</li>
        <li>making the bands&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first four tasks are described here.&nbsp; The jacket and bands are
      described in Part II&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              paint.&nbsp; The photo shows the boiler after the stripping.&nbsp;
              The&nbsp; throttle gland and pivot fixture were not removed.&nbsp;
              All other plumbing was removed and the holes plugged.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The cheapest stripper I could get at Wal-Mart was used (~$4/qt and
              it took less than&nbsp; a quart.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The boiler will be
              blasted after all the spacers are tack welded in place.&nbsp;</td>

              the smoke box.&nbsp; The last holes on each end were then drilled
              all the way through and an old drill though the fixture and one of

              difference between the slope of the jacket and the slope of the
              top of the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is true but now I don't
              think it's a problem.

              I was able to wrap one arm around the fire box area and hold the boiler

              enlarged them to 3/32&quot;&nbsp; which might have be too
              big.&nbsp; The #43 drill is probably a better choice,&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              hole, installed a screw, filed off the head,&nbsp; reinstalled the
              drilling fixture, and then marked and drilled a new hole that was
              perfectly aligned.&nbsp; After all that I realized that the misaligned

              I'd&nbsp; installed 1/4&quot; square spacers adjacent to the cab
              front and around the rear boiler mounts at the same time the rear boiler
              clamps were made.&nbsp;&nbsp;The square bars were tack
              welded to the boiler about every two inches using a
              small flux-in-wire welder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The procedure that worked
              best&nbsp; was to heat the center of the bar with the propane
              torch and bend the bar over the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bare
              was positioned&nbsp; and the first weld was made in the center of
              the bend.&nbsp; The t 3 or 4 inch section next to the weld was
              then heated and,&nbsp; bent to shape and then
              welded.&nbsp; The weld was made at least 1&quot; back from the end
              of the correct bend because it was difficult to heat the part next

      <p><b>Boiler Top Layout: </b>Before proceeding it was decided to nail down here
      to&nbsp; place the sand dome, bell, generator and handrail
      stanchions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next photo shows how things are positioned on
      Cass 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Cass5.jpg" width="700" height="375"></p>
      <p>This layout is slightly different than the one Kenneth used.&nbsp; He
      has the sand dome about midway between the steam dome and the smokestack
      and the bell behind the steam dome.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no generator
      shown on his photos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken uses two jacket pieces with the joint
      at the transition in front of&nbsp; steam dome.&nbsp; I was beginning to
      worry about the rear piece where I'd want good alignment with the front of
      the cab and also with the front of the firebox.&nbsp;&nbsp; That looked
      like too many constrains and I'd end up making it two or three
      times.&nbsp; After due consideration (the coin flipping process) decided on the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Locate the sand dome near the front of the sloped section of the
          boiler as on Cass 5.&nbsp; This will require a small bend in the left side
          sander pipes so that they can pass behind the air compressor.&nbsp; I think
          my compressor is mounted slightly further back than on Cass
          5.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Position the bell midway between the sand dome and steam dome.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Make a joint in the jacket behind the steam dome such that the steam
          dome is midway between the two joints.&nbsp; This is slightly ahead of
          the joint on Cass 5 shown above.&nbsp;<br>
        </li>
        <li>Locate the generator behind the rear joint.&nbsp; This will give a
          little more room for the generator.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Locate four handrail stanchions on each side of the boiler
          positioned as on Cass 5 (the rear one will be just behind the rear
          band.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <div align="center">

            <td><b>Pads:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> The pads to support the domes, bell,
              generator and handrail stanchions were made from pieces of 6&quot;
              pipe like used for the boiler.&nbsp; The inside of the pipe was bored to thin the cross
              section to 1/4&quot;.&nbsp; An abrasive saw as then used to cut
              off the sections for the pads. The piece in the photo is for the
              sand dome pad.&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggggggg&nbsp; burner for the
              propane torch is being used to heat the piece.&nbsp;&nbsp; (While
              waiting for it to heat I started to think that all I needed

              son noticed the new anvil some time back asked &quot;is it an Acme

              will be more than the spacer thickness away from the boiler near
              the front part of the sloped section.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pad was shimmed away from the
              boiler as shown.&nbsp; The straight rod was used to make sure the the top of the pad
              was aligned with the spacers.&nbsp; The masking tape
              held everything in position while a couple spots were tack
              welded.&nbsp; The tape and shims were then removed and the pad

      another spacer was added behind the steam dome for that second joint in
      the jacket.&nbsp; The exact placement of the bell, generator and handrail
      stanchions hadn't been decided at this point so the pads are much larger&nbsp; than necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; A straight rod was used to test
      for high spots in the pads and any high spots were ground down to the
      point that they were even with the jacket spacers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
