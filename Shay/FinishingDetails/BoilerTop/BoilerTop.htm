        covers the handrails and bell details on the top of the
        boiler. &nbsp;</font></p>

      <p align="left">The photo above shows the bell and handrails on Cass 5
      which I chose to copy.&nbsp; The next photo shows the engine side of NLW No
      1.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="BellRail.jpg" width="720" height="254"></p>
      <p align="left">The bell is a casting set from <a href="http://www.livesteam.com/bell/bellkit.html">Railroad
      Warehouse</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The base is made from a&nbsp; piece of 1&quot;
      diameter brass
      rod.&nbsp; The bottom was machined to the correct radius at
      the same time the bottom of the sand dome was machined.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      bell U-shaped casting is attached with a 4-40 screw through that round
      base&nbsp; into a 1/4&quot; thick spacer previously welded to the top of the
      boiler.&nbsp; A socket head screw was
      used and recessed flush with the casting.&nbsp; The bell was sanded (50 grit, then 80, then 220 and finally 400 grit) to remove all
      pits and then polished with rubbing compound.&nbsp; The sanding and
      polishing was done with the bell mounted in the 3-jaw chuck via the little
      stub at the top.&nbsp; The stub was sawed off after the polishing was
      completed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The U shaped casting has a extension on one side to
      mount&nbsp; a bell operating
      cylinder --- that part was sawed off.&nbsp; All bell parts except the bell
      and acorn nut on the top were painted (powder coated) black.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">The handrail stanchions are also from <a href="http://www.livesteam.com/handrailstantions/handrailstantions.html">Railroad
      Warehouse</a> --- part number C-2114-1, the smallest&nbsp; size.&nbsp; The
      remains of the sprue was filed off each stanchion and then the lower end
      threaded 8-32.&nbsp; The threaded part of six of the stanchions was cut
      back to 3/16&quot; length.&nbsp; The 3/16&quot; hole was reamed to 13/64&quot; to
      give some
      room for the bend handrail.&nbsp; The handrail is 3/16&quot; thin wall
      tubing (K&amp;S) available in 3' lengths from <a href="http://www.mcmaster.com">McMaster-Carr.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Clearance holes for the two stanchions mounted to the smoke box were&nbsp;
      drilled through and the stanchion secured with a nut and washer inside the
      smoke box.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other six stanchions were mounted in 1/4&quot;
      deep holes tapped 8-32.&nbsp; These holes were in the 1/4&quot; spacers
      welded to the boiler for this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;The rear three
      stanchions for each handrail were screwed in place first and the
      stanchion&nbsp; for the smoke box slipped over the handrail.&nbsp; The
      handrail was carefully threaded into the rear three stanchions.&nbsp; The
      tube is flexible enough to bend to the required shape.&nbsp; After
      the&nbsp; handrail was in position in the rear three stanchions, it was
      pulled away from the smoke box and the threaded part of the last stanchion
      inserted through the hole in the smoke box and secured with washer and
      nut.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">The balls are 11/32&quot; brass from McMaster-Carr.&nbsp;
      Holes for the handrail (3/16&quot;)&nbsp; were drilled about 1/4&quot;
      deep into each ball.&nbsp; &nbsp; A fixture was made to assist in drilling the
      holes.&nbsp; A ~1&quot; long piece of ~ 3/4&quot; steel rod was center
      drilled 11/32&quot; about 5/8&quot; deep and then the rest of the way
      through with a 3/16&quot; drill.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; 11/32&quot; hole
      was tapped about&nbsp; 7/16&quot; deep 3/8&quot;-24.&nbsp;&nbsp; A ball is
      dropped in the 11/32&quot; hole and held in position with a 3/8&quot;
      bolt.&nbsp; The ball is then drilled 3/16&quot; while in the fixture using the
      3/16&quot; hole in the fixture as a guide.&nbsp;&nbsp; The end of the bolt
      left a small flat part on the balls.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next time I'll slip a
      piece of aluminum between the ball and the bolt.&nbsp; The balls are held in place
      on the tubes with a couple drops
      of Loctite.&nbsp;</p>

              handrail adjacent to the front of the cab and drops down and goes
              through the cab front via the opening for&nbsp; the left side feed water
