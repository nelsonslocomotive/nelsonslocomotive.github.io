              different.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ladder on many tenders loops over the
              rear edge of the tank and fastens to the top of the tank.&nbsp;
              This ladder attaches to the rear of the tank at the top and to the floor
              on the bottom,&nbsp; which permits the top of the tank to be removed without fooling with the
              ladder.&nbsp;</td>

              had wondered how the sanders worked since there didn't seem to be
              a cable to turn them on.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's my guess that the small
              pipe supplies air to the tee type fitting at the bottom of the sander
              tank.&nbsp; I'm guessing that the tee like fitting is an air
              operated valve. &nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
