      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Let's start with a bit of
      history:&nbsp;&nbsp; Lima used two types of frames on the Class B (2
      truck) and Class C (3 truck) shays.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sketch below
      from a reprint of a Lima&nbsp; Service Department Instruction Booklet
      shows the two types.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both these frames are for Class B
      Shays.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Class C frames are nearly identical; the major
      difference being that the part behind the rear truck is much
      shorter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="FrameTypes.jpg" width="700" height="212"></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The upper frame is the later
      Girder type introduced in the 1910 - 1920 period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The lower frame is the </font><font face="Engravers MT">I</font><font face="Arial">
      Beam or Truss Rod type used from the beginning on the Class B and Class C
      Shays and is the type Kenneth used in his design.&nbsp;</font><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The main frame construction
      went much
      easier than the tender frame because I'd developed some expertise doing
      the tender frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following drawing&nbsp; is the 3-Truck
      Main frame provided by Kenneth.&nbsp;&nbsp; There' a half dozen more
      drawings for the main frame showing details such as coupler pockets, queen
      posts, etc.&nbsp; ( These drawings are available from Kenneth.)&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">The sketch below is from
      a reprint of a Lima Spare Parts Book .&nbsp; This main frame went with the
      tender frame sketch shown in the tender frame note.&nbsp;&nbsp; My guess
      is that it's from the 1900 - 1910 period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excepting the
      curved rear end, it's a nearly exact match for Kenneth's drawing above. </font><img border="0" src="LimaDwg1.jpg" width="699" height="106"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">If one examines the frame drawing it will be obvious that the frame is not symmetrical around the
      center line of the track or trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recall that the
      engine is on the right side of the locomotive.&nbsp; The boiler is off
      center toward the left side of the locomotive to make room for the engine
      and to balance the weight of the engine.&nbsp;&nbsp; The boiler is
      centered on the side </font><font face="Engravers MT">I</font><font face="Arial">

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">I made my main frame is
      exactly to Kenneth's drawing with the following exceptions:</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The channels were screwed
          together using button head cap screws (simulated rivets)&nbsp; rather
          than welded&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The triangle frame
          brackets were used instead of the flat bar frame brackets.</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Some cosmetic details were
          added such as rivet detail for bolster supports and a front sill
          support.&nbsp;</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The following construction sequence was
      used on the main frame.&nbsp; This is a little different from the tender
      frame since I knew where I was headed and had a pretty good idea&nbsp; of
      how to get there.</font></p>

              together.&nbsp; A clearance hole was drilled in the outer channel
              and the inner channel threaded for button head cap screws.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; There
              are two&nbsp; like the one shown below on each side of the main

      <p align="left">The truss rods looked to be a quick job until I counted up
      all the required parts as shown in the photo below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      (When the truss rods were installed later it was discovered&nbsp; that 4
      more of the brass nuts were required.)&nbsp; As
      you'll see later, the truss rods add nice detail. <img border="0" src="TrussRod.jpg" width="700" height="182"></p>
      <p align="left">The frame brackets were made using the same technique as
      described for the tender.&nbsp; If fact, the same fixture used on the
      tender frame was used to fabricate the smaller
      brackets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These brackets were made from 20 gauge
      steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; brackets and the truss rod details above took
      over half the main frame effort.</p>

          <tr>
            <td width="50%" valign="top">I reviewed the Lima drawing shown on
              the right&nbsp; before
              deciding how to fabricate the front sill and related brackets,
              braces, etc.&nbsp; The bracket between the frame and the sill
              channel is exactly like the bracket Kenneth shows in his
              drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made angle brackets for each side of each <font face="Engravers MT">I </font><font face="Arial">beam</font>
              to attach to the upper part of the wooden sill.&nbsp;
              <p>There is a brace from the right <font face="Engravers MT">I </font><font face="Arial">beam</font>
              to the back of the sill to support&nbsp; the sill that &nbsp; sticks out
              quite a distance from&nbsp; the <font face="Engravers MT">I </font><font face="Arial">beam.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              This brace makes a nice detail to add.&nbsp;</font></p>
              <p>The photo directly below the drawing shows one of these braces
              on Cass No 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The end that attaches to the <font face="Engravers MT">I </font><font face="Arial">beam</font>&nbsp;is
              different from the drawing above.&nbsp; Also note that the bottom
              of the triangle bracket is cut to provide clearance for the
              brace.&nbsp; The brace seems to be bent a bit to make room
              and to support the tool/storage box. </p>
              <p>My model of this area is shown in the photo below. That is the
              the under side of the right front.&nbsp; The frame was still under
              construction at this point and only a few screws are&nbsp; used to
              hold everything together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Button head screws
              (simulated rivets) will be used everywhere except into the sill
              where 4-40 hex head screws (simulated bolts) will be used.&nbsp; </p>
