      a plate on the other end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I chose&nbsp;to turn the end
      pieces from 3/8&quot; rod,&nbsp; drill a 1/4&quot; hole through the ends, slide
      the ends on a 1/4&quot; rod and solder everything together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      template for drilling holes in the frame to mount the queen
      posts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1/4&quot; rod&nbsp; extends below the bottom plate

      <p><b>Truss Plates:</b>&nbsp; There are four plates used to interconnect
      pieces of the truss rods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step was to
      cut the plates from bar stock.&nbsp; The pieces were clamped together and
      the 3/16&quot; holes for the truss rods drilled though all four at the
      same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expansions pins were then used to hold the four
      pieces together.&nbsp; The next step was to mill the edges to the correct
      dimensions as shown on the left.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right photo shows milling
      the
      sides to the correct slope.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brass pieces
      are used to prop up the end to get the correct angle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      This technique was easily reproduced to mill the other three similar
      surfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p>The last step was to use a rounding end mill as shown on the

      below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of the few times that I've been able
      to exactly match Kenneth's drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

      <p><b>Engine-Tender Coupling:&nbsp; </b>The coupling between the engine and
      tender is fabricated from angle and flat stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The drawings call for 5/16&quot; thick angle.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step
      was to rough cut the angle as shown on the left'.&nbsp; I used
      3/8&quot; thick since 5/16&quot; angle wasn't available.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      next step was to thin the angle using a fly cutter as shown in the middle
      photo.&nbsp; The resulting&nbsp; 5/16&quot; thick angle is shown on the
      right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      </div>
      <p>The next step was to attach the flat pieces to the angle.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
      milled a slot in the angle to position one flat piece and milled a slot in the bottom
      flat piece to position it to the bottom of the angle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rough
      cuts were made to the pieces and than all the parts were screwed and
      silver soldered together.&nbsp; The photo on the left shows the soldered
      pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle photo shows milling the angle on the flat
      pieces.&nbsp; The next step was to use the side of the end mill to round
      the meeting of the back and the side edges.&nbsp; The result of this is
      shown on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      </div>
      <p>The next step was the use a rounding end mill to finish the point of
      the coupling.&nbsp; The left&nbsp; photo below shows using a cardboard
      wedge to position&nbsp; the coupling in the milling vise.&nbsp; The same
      wedge was used in some of the earlier operations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last
      step was to drill the hole for the pin.&nbsp;&nbsp; The finished coupling
      is shown below on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; The coupling is very close to
      Kenneth's drawings and looks quite nice.</p>

              milled to about 3/32&quot; thickness.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 3/16&quot;
              square reinforcement bar was silver soldered to the angle.&nbsp; To
              simplifying positioning the bar, a slot was milled in the edges of
              the angle.&nbsp; The bar was merely positioned in the slots and
              soldered as shown on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The end of
              the bars was then milled flush to the back sides of the angle after
