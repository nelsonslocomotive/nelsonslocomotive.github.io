            the tender floor.&nbsp; I was unhappy with some of the cutouts and
            the way the floor fit around the boiler so I
            made this second cab floor.&nbsp; The material is 1/8&quot; thick hot
            rolled sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp; The floor is fastened to the frame I beams
            with four 6-32&nbsp; flat socket head screws.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cutout
            is for the fuel tank output hose and drain
            valve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            to the under side of
            the outer edge.&nbsp; The
            oxide coating was sanded off the plates before the strip was clamped
            in place.&nbsp; The corner between the plate and strip was coated
            several times with Ruby Flux and heated.&nbsp; Some solder was then
            melted into the corner and spread with the flux brush after it was
            dipped again in flux.&nbsp;&nbsp; This type solder doesn't flow as
            readily as the 50-50 lower temperature solder.&nbsp; However, a
            really nice joint can be made using this
            technique.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It helps to practice a little on a
            couple scrap pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    <p align="left"><b>Roof:</b>&nbsp; Kenneth used a roof with a hole cut in the
            center to access the controls.&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked the look of a
            design shown in <u>So You Want to Build A Live Steam Locomotive</u>
            that has the rear of the roof propped up to access the
            controls.&nbsp; I wanted a design that:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Had a flat position for photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Had an elevated position for viewing the gauges and accessing
        the controls.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Permitted the roof to be easily removed
            for access to the plumbing in the cab. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

            sheet.&nbsp; The frame was silver soldered together.&nbsp; The props
            are 1/8&quot; X 1/4&quot; CFS with 4-40 screws into the frame side
            serving as pivots.&nbsp; The roof sheet is 18 gauge steel and&nbsp;

            sides just in front of the door openings.&nbsp; U shaped retainers

            1/4&quot; wide 1/8&quot; deep slot.&nbsp; The retainers were screwed
            to the stiffener strips using #0 button head cap screws. The roof
