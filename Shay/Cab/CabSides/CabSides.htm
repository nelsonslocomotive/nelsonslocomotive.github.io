    <p align=left>The plan was to put off the constructing the cab to the very
    end with the other cosmetic details.&nbsp;&nbsp; The locomotive will operate
    without the cab.&nbsp;&nbsp;On a recent visit to Cass I was told that they
    had done a several mile test run of the recently reconditioned Heisler without
    the cab ----- as I recall the boiler lagging hadn't&nbsp; been applied
    either.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>However, when trying to layout the various controls and
    plumbing around the backhead it became clear that the cab walls would&nbsp;
    be very useful to get a correct perspective.&nbsp; So, I decided to make the
    two sides and front now and finish the cab later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            design used double windows on each side.&nbsp; Both designs were

            sides were soldered together at the corners and cut&nbsp; at the
            same time using a band saw.&nbsp; The saw was run through the top
            edge to cut the windows.&nbsp; The cuts in the top were later silver
            soldered closed.&nbsp; The sawed edges were finished with a
            file.&nbsp; The rivet holes for the front and bottom were located
            using the same drilling fixture as used for the tanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Only half the holes in the fixture were used --- rivets were stuck
            in the holes not used.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The same 1/16&quot; OD rivets as
            used on the tanks will be used on the cab.)&nbsp; The cutout for
            rear cylinder on the
            right side was made after the two sides were unsoldered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            1/16&quot; brass rivet that holds
            the square stock.&nbsp; The other rivets are 1/8&quot; long
            1/16&quot; copper&nbsp; that only go
            through the sides.&nbsp; The brass rivets were too short to go all
            the way through the squares so&nbsp; 3/32&quot; holes were drilled half
            way through the inner side and the rivet was peened over inside the
            hole using a 3/23&quot; punch.&nbsp; The squares on the front edges were set back the width
            of the front.&nbsp;&nbsp; That made the rivet holes close to the
            edge of the squares, so close that some of the 3/32&quot; holes went
            through the sides of the squares as shown in upper photo on

            placement was not good.&nbsp; The windows needed to be moved toward
            the corners by about 3/8&quot; and the lower edge of the windows
            raised somewhat.&nbsp; I waited until all the pipes were installed and then
            made the new front pictured on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first
            front was used as a drilling template for the this second front making
