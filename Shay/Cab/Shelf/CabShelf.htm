    <p align=left>The plan was to go back and add to the first Cab page as
    additional work was done on the cab.&nbsp; However, it is now clear that the
    design of parts of the cab are heavily dependent on the
    layout of the plumbing and it is normal for one to fabricate sections of the cab
    in coordination with construction of other areas of the locomotive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new plan for the Cab documentation is to cover the cab
    in the following three&nbsp; short pages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p align="left">&nbsp; The cab sides</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">&nbsp; Cab shelf over the rear cylinder and platform
        over reversing gear</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">&nbsp; Cab roof,&nbsp; floor and walkways&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left">This is the page devoted to the shelf and platform.&nbsp; <font size="3" face="Arial">These
    parts are integrated with the plumbing because the brake valve and whistle valve will be located on the shelf and the atomizer
    regulator will be located under the platform.&nbsp; From a maintenance point
    of view,&nbsp; it is desirable to be able to access each piece of plumbing without
    disconnecting other</font> plumbing.&nbsp; For example, one wants to be able to access
    the plumbing under the cab floor without disconnecting the brake and
    atomizer plumbing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversely, one wants to be able to get
    at the brake and atomizer plumbing without disconnecting any of the water or
    steam plumbing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These concerns have led to the following
    cab disassembly features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p align="left">The cab front, sides and roof can be removed as a unit
        without disturbing any plumbing.&nbsp; Once the 8&nbsp; screws are removed, the cab can be lifted off vertically.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">The cab floor can be removed after the cab front and
        sides have been removed by taking out an additional 7 screws,
        sliding it back about one inch and to the left about 1/2
        inch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">There are screws from the cab front and sides into the
        platform/shelf unit.&nbsp; However, the platform is also anchored to the frame via the
        reversing gear stand so that is supported after the cab sides and front
        as well as the floor have been removed.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Access to the atomizer regulator ( a likely high failure
        rate component) is via the cover over the platform.&nbsp; That cover can
        be removed without taking out any other parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

            fitting between the cab front, cab side, and the boiler.&nbsp;
            Pieces of 1/8&quot; square rod were silver soldered to the edges
            next to the cab front and side edges to give sufficient width for
            screw holes.&nbsp;
            Holes&nbsp; for #1 button cap screws were drilled and tapped in four
            rivet&nbsp; positions near the corners.&nbsp; The self top and back
            were silver soldered together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pieces were held together with 1/16&quot;
            roll pins for the silver soldering.&nbsp; For example, the 1/8&quot;
            rods were first soldered to the shelf top and shelf back and then
            the top and
            back were soldered together in a separate

            <p>Comment:&nbsp; The shelf is much thicker than the cab front and
            side because it must remain rigid when supported only by the the
            platform side screwed to the reversing gear stand.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            edges are not visible so the extra thickness is hidden.&nbsp; The
            platform on the prototype is made from wood so the 0.100&quot; plate
            is roughly to scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Holes have been cut in the cab floor and then the configuration
            changed&nbsp; so that some holes are no longer needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Also, the cab floor ended at the back of the boiler.&nbsp; It now
            appears that a better design would be to run the left side of the
            cab floor up to the front of the cab.&nbsp; A new cab floor will be
            made after the&nbsp; locations of all holes are firm. (This is one
            area where I don't want to follow the prototype by putting little
            patches over unused holes.)&nbsp;</p>
