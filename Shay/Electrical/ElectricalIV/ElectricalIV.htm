            <td><b>Cab Light: </b>The LEDs seemed to work well for the headlamp
              so a LED was tried for the cab light. The LED (#276-320) and LED
              holder (#272-080) were purchased from Radio Shack.&nbsp; The LED
              is rated at&nbsp; 3.6 volts/20 ma.&nbsp; A 75 ohm 1/4 watt series resistor
              was&nbsp; used to limit the current from the 3-cell 4.5 volt
              supply.&nbsp; The current is about 15 ma which gives off more
              than enough light.&nbsp; The holder is mounted in the brass
              bracket shown in photo on right.&nbsp; The bracket&nbsp; is
              fastened to the left side of the cab using two of
              the screws that attach the left side roof prop
              retainer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The piece above the lamp is a
              shade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              short line and logging railroads where there was no way to
              turn them around so they ran forward in one direction and
              backwards in the other direction.&nbsp;&nbsp; As seen in
              the photo on the right, the Cass 5 tender headlamp is identical to
              the headlamp at the front.&nbsp; The mounting arrangement is
              however simpler.&nbsp; The lamp case attaches directly to the base
              which in turn is held above the tender top with rods or pieces of
              pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            <td><b>Tender Lamp: </b>The photo shows the finished tender
              lamp.&nbsp; The basic lamp was made just like the headlamp.&nbsp;
              A brass base was made by milling a radius to match the radius of
              the lamp case.&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat base is steel.&nbsp; The
              spacers are 3/16&quot; copper plumbing tube.&nbsp; The base is
              attached to the tender top with 4-40 screws that go through the
              spacer tubes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>When making the front headlamp I found that it was very
              difficult to get silver solder as well as soft solder to stick to
              the exhaust tube used for the lamp case.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time it
              was impossible to solder to the tube.&nbsp; I had assumed the
              material was plain steel.&nbsp; If it is steel, it has some
              additive to keep solder from sticking --- maybe it's a corrosion preventative.&nbsp;
              This time all the parts were screwed
              together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <p><b>Lamp Wiring:</b> The feed wire for the headlamp and cab lamp goes
      from the connector between the tender and the locomotive (see Electrical
      I),&nbsp; under the cab floor and then up through the hole for the left side feed water
      pipes at the left rear of the backhead.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is to
      install female pin plugs on the power wire and use male pin plugs on the end of the cab lamp and headlamp wires.
      The three are currently tied together with a wire nut in the left front
      bottom corner of the cab.&nbsp; The cab
      lamp wire runs along the bottom edge of the left cab side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      headlamp wire is currently fastened to the feed water pipes on the left side
      of the boiler and then along the pipes than run down the rear of the boiler.&nbsp;
      This wire will run in the hand rail when it is installed
      later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The tender lamp power wire is routed from the switch panel to under the
      overflow pipe.&nbsp; The lamp wire goes into the tank through a
      grommet under the lamp and then down the overflow pipe. &nbsp; The two wires are
      currently connected together under the tender frame using a wire
      nut.&nbsp; That connection will also be converted a pin plug at some
      point.</p>
      <p>I think this finishes everything needed to run the shay at the
      track.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem now is to get to the track and to get the
      shay to run.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
