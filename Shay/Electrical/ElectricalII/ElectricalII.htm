      <p align="left"><b>Headlights: </b>The Shays of the early 1900s had&nbsp;oil lantern type
      headlamps.&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on photos and comments in Philip Brogan's book <u>Shay
      Logging Locomotives At Cass, West Virginia, 1900-60</u>, the switch from
      oil to electric headlamps occurred at Cass around 1920.&nbsp; The oil lamps on
      the first couple Cass Shays had large square cases.&nbsp; The majority of the
      oil headlamps had 16&quot; round cases similar to the later electric
      headlamps.&nbsp;&nbsp; The round oil lamp had a squat chimney on the top whereas the electric lamp had a smooth
      top.&nbsp; Some of the oil lamps had number boards on the sides as did
      some of the later electric lamps.&nbsp;&nbsp; Castings for a
      Pyle type lamp with side number boards&nbsp; are available&nbsp; from <a href="http://www.livesteam.com/">Railroad
      Warehouse</a>&nbsp; and they also offer an assembled Sunbeam type lamp
      that is a close match for the round case&nbsp; electric headlamps used at
      Cass.&nbsp; This assembled lamp is equipped with a 12 volt Halogen bulb
      that is a mismatch for my 6 volt system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; choice is to model the electric or the oil lamp.&nbsp; If the electric
      lamp is modeled, then one would want to have a steam powered
      generator.&nbsp; Castings for a non operating Pyle generator are available
      from <a href="http://www.lsmfg.com/index.htm">LS </a> <a href="http://www.lsmfg.com/index.htm">Manufacturing</a>.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Recall that limited power is available via a set
      of D cells under the tender so I decided to try LEDs.&nbsp; A couple of
      the large LED flashlights were purchased from Harbor Freight to get the
      LEDs, lens and reflector.&nbsp; The item description from the Harbor Freight
      website is shown below.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The equivalent resistance of the resistor plus diodes at 4.5 volts input
    is (4.5 volts divided by 0.4 amperes ) about 11 ohms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly,
    the equivalent resistance at 3.6 volts input is about 18
    ohms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The technical specification for the Eveready E95 energizer alkaline D
      cell was downloaded from <a href="http://www.eveready.com">www.eveready.com</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The constant resistance curves were then used to find a typical
    service life at a 1.2 volts cutoff (3.6 volts for 3 cells) of ~80 hours for
    a 11 ohm load and ~ 150 hours for 18 ohms.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 100 hour service
      life is probably a good estimate.&nbsp; If this estimate proves to be accurate
      then rechargeable batteries aren't worth
    the effort &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="left">At this point I was undecided as to whether to make the
    number boards or to make the headlamps like the Cass 11 lamp with no number
    boards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number boards looked like a pain to make and I
    was in a hurry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also knew that If I made them without the
    number boards I'd regret it later.&nbsp; So, put the project aside and
    worked on the lawn for a day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing like lawn work to provide
    motivation to work on the shay!&nbsp;&nbsp; The lamp will be finished in Part III</p>
