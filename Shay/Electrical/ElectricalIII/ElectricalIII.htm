      <p align="left">The headlamp was started in Part II.&nbsp; The numbers
      boards appeared to be a chore so the project was set aside for a couple
      days.&nbsp; We pick up here with making the number board bases and then
      the number board cover and finally the headlamp legs.&nbsp; The last part
      is the base that goes between the lamp and the smoke box or
      tender.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            3/8&quot; thickness could also have been used.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step was to machine a 1.125&quot; radius
            on the bottom to match the outside of the case.&nbsp; The photo
            shows using a boring head for this operation.&nbsp; A fly cutter
            could also have been used. This was the first use of the new boring
            head ---- worked great.&nbsp;</td>

              <p>At a break from track work at Mill Creek Central I mentioned
              that the headlamp would use LEDs. &nbsp; Ed Carl
              mentioned that some of the guys had trouble with incandescent bulb
              life in headlamps due to heat.&nbsp; They solved the problem by insulating
              the headlamp from the smoke box.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good point!&nbsp;
              The&nbsp; LEDs and plastic lens are probably even more heat
              sensitive.&nbsp;Teflon washers and
              inserts were considered but then I remembered some 0-80 nylon screws. Neoprene
              washers for #6 screws used to seal the bottom of the tender tank
              were placed between the lamp legs and the top of the
              base.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The excess screw length will be trimmed if
              they don't melt first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              lamp.&nbsp; The 4.5 volt lead has a big knot inside the lamp to
              prevent it from being pulled out.&nbsp; Small wire nuts were used

      <p>The photos above show the Cass No 5 lamp beside my model. Close enough!&nbsp;
      (The little bumps on the model are water drops --- the shay had just been
      given a bath.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo below shows the lamp in a better
      perspective.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="Finished.jpg"></p>
      <p>The lamp was tested in the dark and it seemed to provide plenty of light.&nbsp;
      However, a light for the&nbsp; water and
      pressure gauge are required to run at night.&nbsp; Then there is the
      problem of getting the wire from the headlamp to the cab&nbsp; --- maybe through a
      handrail.&nbsp; Then there's wiring for the tender headlamp.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The intention was to make this the last of the electrical pages but have
      now decided to put the remaining items in Electrical IV.&nbsp;</p>
