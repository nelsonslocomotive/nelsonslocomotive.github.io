      <p align="left">There are two electrical requirements for the shay:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left">An igniter to relight the oil burner.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;Headlamps on both ends and
          possibly cab lights to illuminate gauges.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The local folks run their locomotives after dark
          so
          working lamps are a
          necessity.)&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">The igniter and battery are discussed in this part and the
      lights will be covered in subsequent parts.</p>
      <p align="left">Unfortunately,&nbsp; no thought&nbsp; had been given to power generation or
      storage during the locomotive construction.&nbsp;
      There is no room for a small auto/motorcycle/lawn equipment type battery.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The best alternative seems to be to stuff (hide) some D
      size cells between the tender frame members.&nbsp;&nbsp; That should be
      sufficient since there's no kids to leave the lights turned on.&nbsp; However, care must be taken to get
      maximum efficiency to extend battery life. To that end an electronically
      controlled 6 volt motorcycle coil was selected for the igniter and LED
      arrays for the lamps.&nbsp; Most the LEDs used in flashlights require&nbsp;
      ~3.9 volts each but can be
      arranged in parallel/series combinations of&nbsp; LEDs and resistors to
      form an array that will work at about any voltage greater than 3.9 volts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The motorcycle
      coil was the least expensive small coil I could find so that fixes the
      voltage at&nbsp; 6 volts or slightly less.&nbsp; Four regular 1.5 volt D
      cells gives 6 volts or four 1.2 volt NiCad or NiMH cells could&nbsp;
      be used to give 4.8 volts which would probably work or a fifth cell added
      to get 6 volts.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to start out with the four 1.5 volt cells and see how that worked out.&nbsp; If battery replacement&nbsp; becomes too
      expensive, I can switch to rechargeable batteries later.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Igniter:&nbsp; </b>The igniter was viewed as the highest
      priority electrical item so it was constructed first. ( A large flashlight
      could be duct tapped to the front sill if needed before the headlamp is
      finished.)&nbsp; Dave Johnson provided much advice on the burner as
      well as the
      spark plug type and plug position as documented in the
      <a href="../../Fire/BurnerTestMods/TestsBurnerMods.htm">Burner
      Test &amp; Modification Page</a> .&nbsp; He also advised that most people
      use a Model T type coil that gives hundreds of sparks per second.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">I'd heard references to Model T coils in a way that
      suggested that they were something special.&nbsp; Being an Electrical
      Engineer I attributed this to a myth or urban legend passed on by the
      uninformed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave said that Model T coils were
      available from <a href="http://www.macsautoparts.com/">Mac's Auto Parts</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I checked out the coils at Mac's and found that four coils were used (one
      per cylinder) and the coils had contact points.&nbsp; Along the way I
      heard the term buzz coil applied to the Model T coil.&nbsp; At this point it
      sounded like they were indeed different; more than just a coil (my
      previous view was
      wrong --- not the first time).&nbsp; I then speculated the distributor
      distributed to the coil primary (6 volts) and that each coil was equipped with a vibrator
      (buzzer) to continuously pulse the coil whenever power was applied.&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp; later
      conversation with my
      older brother confirmed the coils were self pulsing.&nbsp;(He also provided some tales about mischief with these coils in his youth.)&nbsp;
      The
      Model T coil sounded great but seemed to be
      larger than I wanted and I suspected that mechanical buzzer/pulser
      consumed significant power.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">A subsequent Internet search&nbsp; found <a href="http://www.jerry-howell.com/Ignition.html">Jerry
      E Howell's</a> website serving ignition needs of small model
      gasoline engines.&nbsp;&nbsp; Howell offers small coils and a kit to make
      an electronic circuit to pulse (buzz) one of his small coils or a 6 volt
      motorcycle coil.&nbsp; The buzzer kit and a few
      feet of small plug wire were purchased from Howell.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 6 volt
      motorcycle coil was purchased from the <a href="http://www.jcwhitney.com">J C Whitney</a>
      website.&nbsp;&nbsp; The size wasn't listed but it turned out to be
      smaller than a typical auto coil as hoped. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

              to follow the instructions to assemble the circuit using a small (~
              35 watt) pencil soldering iron.&nbsp; For you
              electronic types, the circuit uses a 555 timer configured as a free running
              oscillator that drives a 3-transistor amplifier that in turn drives
              the coil.&nbsp;&nbsp; The output transistor has a very high
              breakdown voltage suitable for working with the coil.&nbsp; The circuit is turned on and off by a
              transistor switch in the 555 IC ground lead.&nbsp; The black wires
              in the photo are all connecting together on the circuit board and
              are connected to the negative battery terminal and the locomotive
              frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; The red leads connect the the positive terminal
              on the battery and to the coil (+) terminal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              yellow wire connects to the coil (-) terminal.&nbsp; The green
              wire is the control wire and is connected to ground to turn the
              circuit on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <p align="left"><b>Igniter Test:&nbsp;</b> This part of the project has
      been done for a few weeks but I didn't want to put it on the website until the igniter
      was tested on a real live fire to make sure
      it actually worked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today (4/15/04) was warm, sunny and beautiful in spite of
      the IRS so I sneaked off from lawn chores and fired up the Shay on the test stand.&nbsp; I couldn't get the burner to light
      initially with the igniter.&nbsp; That may have been because the fuel setting was
      incorrect.&nbsp; Once lit and adjusted properly I temporarily
      shut the atomizer valve --- flame went out --- then turned it back on ---
      then&nbsp; pressed the igniter switch ----- wow! ----it&nbsp; worked!&nbsp;&nbsp;
      After testing it a half dozen times I then played with burner
      adjustment.&nbsp; I found a bigger air hole is required at the rear
      of the pan --- the flame went out under full load unless the door was
      opened slightly.&nbsp;&nbsp; While fooling with this and other problems,
      the burner went out at least 25 times --- igniter relit&nbsp; it every
      time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">On a sadder note, the pretty blue high voltage wire near
      the spark plug is toast ---------- RIP.&nbsp; At times flames came out
      around the spark plug and went after that plug wire.&nbsp; The burner
      nozzle is horizontal and&nbsp; pointed right at the plug base.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Maybe if I tilt it up a bit away from the plug hole, flames won't come out
      the plug hole (DAH).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
