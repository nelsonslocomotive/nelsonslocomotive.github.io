      <p align=left><font size="3" face="Arial">Steam condenses when it
      enters a cold cylinder.&nbsp; The cylinder cocks are
      valves located at each end of each cylinder that are
      opened to drain this condensate (water).&nbsp;&nbsp; The next photo (courtesy
      of friend Murry Mercier) shows the cylinder cocks on Cass No
      5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The escaping steam indicates that the cocks are open
      --- maybe to warm the cylinders.&nbsp;</font></p>

            <p align="left">The photo on right shows the cocks on one cylinder
            in more detail.&nbsp; All 6 are ganged together and operated by a
            single lever in the cab.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">Apparently cocks are not required on the 1.5&quot;
            scale shay engine.&nbsp; However, cocks make the engine look
            authentic and steam coming out of the open cocks looks neat!&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">I was unable to find manufactured cocks that look
            like these.&nbsp; The closest is Coles' straight nose cocks.&nbsp;
            However, the handles would need to be modified to gang the six
            together and the output is straight out rather than down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">The cocks are quite simple, consisting of a body and
            a plug.&nbsp; When the cock is open there is a hole from the input
            in the body , through the plug and then through the output from the
            body.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cock is closed by rotating the the
            plug.&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenge is to make a reasonably tight seal when
            the cock is closed.&nbsp; The full sized cocks use a tapered plug
            with a matching taper in the body.&nbsp; There is an adjustment to
            hold the plug securely in the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p align=left>I checked out Kozo Hiraoka'a three books on building the Shay,
    the Climax and the Heisler.&nbsp;&nbsp; He used both straight and tapered
    plugs.&nbsp; In the last of the three books he said that he favors the straight plug because it is easier to
    fabricate and more reliable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align=left>Last year I tried to make some cocks ---- and they leaked
    really bad.&nbsp; A few months later tried again.&nbsp; A second set of
    failures.&nbsp; I was testing with125 psi air and not looking for a 100%
    seal, but 98% or so was a reasonable objective ---- and the best that could
    be achieved&nbsp; was a perceptible difference in flow when the cock was
    moved from open to close.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shutting off the flow was a fantasy at
    that point.</p>
    <p align=left>After some months of thought I concluded that I couldn't make tapered plugs that would seal since both the plug and a
    reamer with identical taper had to be fabricated.&nbsp; The standard taper
    pins were tried and found that they would seize --- the taper is too
    shallow.&nbsp; So, it has to be straight plugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align=left>The next task was to find a way to make a tight seal with a
    straight plug.&nbsp;&nbsp; Teflon was selected; the idea
  was to surround the plug with Teflon and to make the hole for the plug undersize.&nbsp; The Teflon is slippery so
  the plug should turn easily relative to the tightness
    of fit.&nbsp; Also, Teflon&nbsp; has some give so it should maintain
    pressure on the plug.&nbsp; Teflon can tolerate temperatures up to 400 degrees
    F so temperature shouldn't be a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <td><b>Models:</b>  On this, the third attempt, a number of models
            were made over a a several day period.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these models are
            shown on the right.&nbsp; The
            handles and plugs weren't trimmed on the early models --- the
            challenge was to find a way to make a good seal.
            <p>It was found that the cock would seal initially but after a
            few operations would start to leak.&nbsp; The hole though the body
            and plug had been drilled after the cock was assembled.&nbsp; It was
            found that the hole through the plug left a burr that tore the
            Teflon after a few operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The solution to this was to drill the hole in the the
            plug in a separate operation and to smooth the the plug before pressing
            it into the Teflon
            sleeve.&nbsp; The first successful model continues to seal after
            several hundred complete revolutions of the plug.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The final version is a reduced size model of the successful model using
            the same size plug and Teflon sleeve with a smaller body and output
            pipe.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The smallest Coles Straight Nose Cock is shown for
            comparison.&nbsp; It uses a tapered plug and spring to keep it tight
            in the body.&nbsp; A nice design if you can make reasonably&nbsp; precise repeatable
            tapers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              machines.&nbsp; Since the
              setup is a significant part of the chore, some spare cocks were
              made for future replacements.&nbsp; Also, the jigs were kept to

          <p>One additional test was done --- several of the cocks were
          submerged in boiling water and there was no noticeable effect --- they
          continued to seal.&nbsp; Also a cock with a small leak ( about 4
          bubbles per second) was submerged in the boiling water and the leak
          stopped within a few tens of seconds.&nbsp; When it was placed in cold
          water it started to leak again within a few 10s of seconds.&nbsp; This
          was repeated a half dozen times, sometimes rotating the pug a couple
          revolutions between submerging.&nbsp; Same results. Suspect that the
          Teflon swells when hot making a better seal.</p>
          <p>The cocks haven't been tested on steam yet but expect good results
          based the boiling water tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <td>This was my first use of the MTP 1/8-56 die.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I used
          the die I found the resulting threads too big to thread into
          elbows.&nbsp;&nbsp; The die as manufactured is not adjustable.&nbsp; I
          cut a slit in one side using a Dremel cutoff disk and then used it in
          a die holder where the retaining screws squeeze the die slightly
          making a smaller OD thread.&nbsp; That fixed the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Care was taken when taping the holes in the cylinder to not run the
          tapered tap in too far making the hole too big.&nbsp;</td>

    <p align=left>The photo above shows the six cocks mounted in the
    cylinders.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shaft linking the three cylinders is 3/32&quot;
    stainless steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The levers on the shaft are identical to the
    levers on the cocks.&nbsp; The little&nbsp; bearing blocks are made from
    1/8&quot; thick brass and retained by one 2-25 screw per
    bearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that I've decided not to use the tubes on the
    discharge side --- at least for now.</p>
          <p align=left><b>Update:</b> The next photo shows the view from the rear of the
  engine.&nbsp; This is an updated photo that shows the cock operating
          lever.&nbsp; It was decided to leave the operating lever outside the
          cab rather than trying to develop some sort of a linkage.&nbsp; Some
          of the prototypes used a similar lever located inside the cab, in a
          location that is hard to reach for the engineer of scale
          model.&nbsp;&nbsp; This outside lever tucks in front of the cab side
          when the cocks are off and is turned nearly horizontal when the cocks
          are opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The shaft and little levers haven't been
          cleaned after the silver soldering.&nbsp; The flux residue will be
          removed and the shaft polished when the engine is disassembled for painting.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
