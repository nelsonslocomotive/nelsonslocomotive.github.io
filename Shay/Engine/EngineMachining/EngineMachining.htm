        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">These pages show some of the I techniques used to machine
        the
        Shay engine parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first engine parts machined were the cylinders,
        crosshead guides and valve stem guides.&nbsp; These were done before I
        though to take photos.&nbsp; The critical facing and boring of the
        cylinders and crosshead guides was done on the lathe using a 4 jaw
        chuck.&nbsp; The heads were also turned on the lathe.&nbsp; A drilling
        template was very carefully fabricated and used to drill the attachment
        holes in the heads, cylinders and crosshead guides.&nbsp; This
        permitted&nbsp; these pieces to fit together in correct alignment.</font></p>

                casting.&nbsp; First, the upper surface was milled flat to form the

                milled flat to form a second reference surface.&nbsp; The slots for the main bearings
                were next.&nbsp;
                Much of the material
                was removed using the drill press before the finial milling
                operations.&nbsp; All four slots were&nbsp; machined at the

                granules or a powder.&nbsp; There is however one drawback; the
                debris sticks to hands and
                clothes leaving a dirty black residue.&nbsp; After washing, the
                residue is transferred to the bottom of a sink or shower where
                it turns to rust in a few seconds, much to the displeasure of

      initially expected.&nbsp; Kenneth provided explicit instructions on how
      to make it.&nbsp; I ended up doing the job twice.&nbsp; The first time I
      used drill rod for the main piece.&nbsp; I somehow got the throw for one
      of the cylinders a little long.&nbsp; While there were some tolerances
      designed in, I though this error was pushing the limits (piston striking
      the heads) so I made a second
      crankshaft --- the second one took no time at all.&nbsp; I used precision ground
      stainless rod rather than drill rod on the second one.&nbsp; The photos
