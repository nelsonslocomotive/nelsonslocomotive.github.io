    <p>The reversing gear is another one of those pieces I've been putting off.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for the postponement was that I wanted
    to duplicate the prototype, especially the sector plates with a lot
    of teeth but didn't have good photos or dimensions
    from&nbsp; the prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reverse gears of several shays
    were
    photographed and measured on a visit to Cass in September 2003.&nbsp; There
    are several variations of reversing gears including steam powered
    reversing gears on some of the larger shays.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The Cass No 10 reversing lever moves through an arc of&nbsp; a little
    over
    50 degrees (measured by holding a protractor on the front view photo above).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The reverse shaft on my shay engine rotates 32 degrees. Kenneth
    specified an arm on the reversing gear longer than the Johnson bar lever
    thus reducing the 32 degrees to a bit less than 30 degrees at the reversing
    gear handle.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think
    the reason that Cass&nbsp; No 10 lever moves about 50 degrees while the
    angle on my Shay is closer to 30 degrees is that the the link levers are longer on
    my shay than on Cass No 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I wanted&nbsp; a bit more lever motion so I could have a few more of
    those neat teeth so I decided on a total lever motion of about 40
    degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; The arm and Johnson bar lever lengths will be adjusted
    as necessary to make things work out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Cass 10 has 2 sector plates (the curved pieces with the teeth).&nbsp;
    There is a heavy vertical bar welded to one of the sector plates which is
    further steadied with the thin rectangular plate.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to
    copy Kozo Hiraoka's design and use only one sector plate with the other set
    of teeth cut in the stand, a vertical plate running down to the
    floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            It has a 1/8&quot; hole and 6/32 shank.&nbsp; I had ordered two, one
            with RH thread and the other LH thread.&nbsp; The one with LH thread
            was shipped from another warehouse and hadn't arrived when this
            photo was taken.&nbsp; I also obtained a 6-32 LH thread tap.&nbsp;
            The plan is to make a coupling threaded LH in one end and RH in the
            other end.&nbsp;
            One ball joint will be screwed into each end and the link length adjusted by&nbsp;
            turning the coupling.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>That is the partially fabricated arm in the photo&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            end is made from 1/8&quot; X 3/8&quot; CFS bar stock that was heated
            and bent in a U shape.&nbsp; The main part of&nbsp; the arm is also
            made from 1/8&quot; X 3/8&quot; stock and silver soldered into a
            shallow 1/8&quot; wide slot milled in the end of the U shaped
            piece.&nbsp; The arm was then ground and&nbsp; filed to make it
            somewhat tapered and the sides of the U shaped end thinned to about
            3/32&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arm was left extra long during the
            fabrication to make handling easier.&nbsp; The last step was to
            drill the 1/4&quot;&nbsp; axel hole and then cut off the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I used a somewhat shorter arm than specified by Ken --- 1.75&quot;
            between the centerlines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            between the reverse and throttle levers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The steam&nbsp;
            brake valve will mount above the rear cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            steam brake lever will be above the reverse lever and below the
            throttle lever.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <p>The bottom leg of the angle is wider and longer&nbsp; than
            needed.&nbsp; There will be some pipes running in this area and the
            angle might be a useful anchor point so I decided to postpone
            reducing the size of that bottom leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
