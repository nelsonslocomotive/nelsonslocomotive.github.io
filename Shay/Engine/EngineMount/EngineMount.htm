      fabricated after the frames were made, many months after the engine was
      put together.&nbsp;</i></font></p>
      <P align="left">While making the line shafts, drive shafts and universal
      joints I kept thinking I'd have to make that dreaded engine mount before
      the drive
      train could be tested.&nbsp; Mid way through the universal joint
      fabrication the lathe drive belt broke.&nbsp; It was going to take over a week to get a
      replacement belt. &nbsp;&nbsp; So, I
      was faced with lawn work or making the engine mount.&nbsp; That was a no
      brainer.&nbsp; </P>
      <P align="left">Kenneth welded the parts of his engine mount.&nbsp; My welds are unsightly and
      about the size of a scale brick so I chose to silver solder the parts of
      the mount.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound silver soldering requires that the joint be
      heated through unlike a weld where the heat can be localized.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Slow thorough heating also heats nearby clamps to the point where they go
      limp, so forget about clamping
      parts to be silver soldered.&nbsp;&nbsp; The parts should be pinned or
      screwed together.&nbsp; I prefer to screw the parts together because it
      permits everything to be checked out before the actual soldering.</P>

            <td valign="middle">The vertical bars were the most difficult to machine because
              there are non right angles on each end.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo on the
              right show how I used the bottom of the milling head as a
              reference point.&nbsp; I merely moved the bars back and forth
              under the ruler while adjusting the angle of the bars until the
              difference in height of two reference points indicated that the
              bars were at the correct angle.&nbsp; (As we see later, I didn't
              get it exactly right --- the angles were off a degree or two.)<p>Note that all four of the bars
              are bolted together so that
              they all are milled in one operation insuring that the four are
              identical.&nbsp;</p>

              be correct, the ends with the bolts were cut off.

    <p align="left">The photo below shows the parts of the mount.&nbsp; (&nbsp;Note that one of the
    engine mounting holes in the
              bottom bar is out of line.&nbsp; This was done to avoid a
              hard spot in the crankcase casting.)&nbsp; The top and
              bottom bars were slotted and tabs were left on the vertical bars
              so that everything interlocked.&nbsp; This design made the mount
              sturdy when held together by the eight screws and kept everything straight
              during the soldering.&nbsp; The
              initial slots in the top and bottom bars were about 0.030&quot; deep.&nbsp;
              After I screwed everything together I found the the bottom to
              stick out about 1/8&quot; too far.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Slight error in the
    angles.)&nbsp; I corrected this
              by making the slots deeper.&nbsp; After everything checked out OK, I
              took it apart again, cleaned the joint areas, fluxed and then
    silver soldered
              everything together.&nbsp; I used very thin solder strips in the
              joints along with small pieces of solder at the edges of the
              joints.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The parts of the lower bar between the pads were sawed out
              after everything was soldered.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The finished mount is show on the right&nbsp; attached to the frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I checked the assembled mount
              earlier, I found the upper bar had to be in the lowest possible
              position on the frame channel to get the lower attachment point at the correct
              height.&nbsp; This in turn left a gap between the upper bar and
              the underside of the top of the frame&nbsp; <font face="Bookman Old Style"><b>I </b></font>beam.&nbsp; This gap was
              sufficient to permit attaching the upper engine supports to the
              top of the upper bar rather than to the top of the frame <font face="Bookman Old Style"><b>I </b></font>beam.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              This make the frame mount a single unit attached to the frame by four
              1/4&quot; bolts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <p>After pushing on the engine while holding the frame steady I
              feel the mound adequately secures the engine to the
              frame&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The frame is also rigid in the vertical
              direction.&nbsp; I did note that it is possible to push the top of
              the engine from side to side slightly.&nbsp; The frame <font face="Bookman Old Style"><b>I </b></font>beam
              flexes&nbsp; some by rotating around the long center axis.&nbsp;
              This will be reduced when the firebox area of the boiler is
              attached to the frame.&nbsp; Lima had a frame cross member
              between the&nbsp; <font face="Bookman Old Style"><b>I </b></font>beams
              just in front of the firebox. I'll install a similar brace if I'm
              still uneasy about the frame rigidity after the boiler is
              installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <p align="left"><b>Update 12/06/03: </b>The mount as described above was
    attached to the frame with four 1/4&quot; bolts.&nbsp; The bolts went
    through the frame from the inside into threaded holes in the
    mount.&nbsp;&nbsp; This worked fine except that the boiler must be removed
    to install or remove the mount.&nbsp; That turned out to be a poor design
    (it was really dumb!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp; changed design so that the
    bolts are installed from the outside through the mount and screw into the
    frame.&nbsp; Since the&nbsp; frame already had 1/4&quot; holes, couldn't
    thread the holes for 1/4&quot; bolts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, installed
    E-Z LOK thin wall threaded inserts in the frame.&nbsp; The insets used were
    threaded 3/8-16 on the outside and 1/4-28 on the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those
    1/4&quot; holes in the frame had to be enlarged (drilled) to 5/16&quot; and
    then tapped 3/8-16 for the inserts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    following website has more detail on these inserts:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.buckeyetriumphs.org/technical/EZLOK/EZLOK.htm">http://www.buckeyetriumphs.org/technical/EZLOK/EZLOK.htm</a></p>
