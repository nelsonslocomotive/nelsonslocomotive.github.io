                castings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cylinder castings are at the top with
                steam chests (the boxes).&nbsp; As you can see, it's a three

                stainless steel stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brass disk near the

        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Valve Components:&nbsp; </b>The valve systems requires many small
        carefully machined parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; These parts for one cylinder are
        shown below.&nbsp;&nbsp; The part in the upper left is the steam chest casting
        that mounts to the side of the cylinder casting.&nbsp; The
        stainless steel steam chest cover is to the right of the steam chest. The
        brass part with little ball is the snifter valve that mounts in the top
        of the steam chest.&nbsp; The larger brass piece is the valve stem
        packing gland which mounts in the lower side of the steam chest.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The machined valve stem guide casting is below the stem chest.&nbsp;
        The two
        little straps screw to the top of the guide to retain the valve stem in
        the guide.&nbsp; The stainless steel reverse shaft bearing block&nbsp; is in the lower left corner.&nbsp; Both the valve stem guide and
        the reverse shaft bearing block mount to the cross head
        guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The bronze block below the steam chest cover is the valve.&nbsp; The
        hex brass part below the valve is the valve adjusting nut.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The stainless steel and bronze valve stem is to the left of the
        valve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="Valve1.jpg" width="666" height="410"></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The large bronze parts on the right are the machined eccentric
        straps.&nbsp;&nbsp; The links blades fabricated from stainless steel
        stock are shown are in the upper right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The flat part with the curved slot in the center of the photo is the reversing link&nbsp; fabricated from stainless steel
        stock.&nbsp; The parts below the reversing link are used in the
        reversing link assembly.&nbsp; These were machined from bronze and
        stainless steel stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; Machining the curved slot in the
        reversing link and a matching curve on one of the bronze parts shown below
        the link was challenging for this amateur machinist using fairly
        primitive equipment.&nbsp; I got it right on the second attempt.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Note:&nbsp; Ken specified cold rolled steel for
        most the engine parts such as the connecting
        rods, heads, steam chest cover, link blades, etc.&nbsp; I chose to use
        304 stainless steel for all these parts
        in an attempt to improve the finished appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was
        probably a mistake since the 304 is really tough.&nbsp; It's going to be cold rolled steel for the trucks.</font> </p>
        <font face="Arial"><b>Valve Operation:&nbsp; </b>The valve design is
                both simple and effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next photo shows the cylinder mounted to crosshead guide with
                the lower head sandwiched in-between.&nbsp; The lower end of the
                piston rod is screwed into the top of the bronze
                crosshead.&nbsp; The upper part of the connecting rod is shown
                fitting into the lower end of the crosshead.&nbsp;</font>
                <p><font face="Arial">I'm holding the valve with the recess in the underside
                visible.&nbsp; The valve moves up and down against the flat
                machined surface of the cylinder side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The steam chest
                bolts to this side of the cylinder.&nbsp; The steam chest is
                connected to the boiler via the throttle (valve) so that the
                interior of the steam chest contains uder pressure.&nbsp; (The
                steam chest contains steam ---- novel)</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial">The center slot on the machined side of
                the cylinder cylinder connects to the exhaust port
                on the right side of the photo.&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper slot
                connects to the very top of the cylinder (the cylinder inside
                the casting) and the lower slot
                connects to the very bottom of the cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                valve moves up and down over the slots to control the input of
                steam from the steam chest to the cylinder and&nbsp; the outlet of steam
                from the cylinder to the exhaust.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;Assume the piston is at the top of the cylinder and the
                valve is near the lower extreme of it's motion.&nbsp; In this position the recess in the valve will be over both the
                middle and lower slots permitting steam to pass from the lower
                part of the cylinder out the lower slot, through the valve
                recess and into the middle slot and on out the exhaust
                port.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time the upper slot is starting to
                be uncovered permitting steam from the interior of the steam
                chest&nbsp; to go through the upper slot into the top of the
                cylinder and push the piston down.&nbsp; As the piston moves
                down, the crankshaft rotates and the eccentric will first push
                the valve down to fully uncover the upper slot and then up so
                that when the piston reaches the bottom of the cylinder
                the&nbsp; the valve will have moved to near it's upper extreme
                closing off the upper slot from the steam in the steam chest and
                opening the upper slot to the exhaust.&nbsp; At the same time
                the lower slot will start to be uncovered&nbsp; to let steam enter
                the lower part of the cylinder and push the piston back
                up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the neat things about a steam
                engine is that is that the piston is powered in both directions.</font> </td>
