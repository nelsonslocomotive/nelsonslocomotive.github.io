      <p align="left">It's been nearly a year since the tender frame was
      constructed.&nbsp; I've now started to paint the tender and decided that
      it'd be nice to finish the end sill so that all the structural parts could
      be painted.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

              5.&nbsp; Most the shays I've seen use the same basic design
              with some variation in the details.&nbsp; I decided to copy the
              Cass 5 design shown here.&nbsp;
              <p>This and other Cass photos on this page were taken in the
              spring of 2003 shortly after I finished the frames.&nbsp; One of
              the purposes of that visit was to obtain more detail on the
              sills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              photo shows some new sills in the Cass Shops.&nbsp; I'm not sure
              whether these pieces are for a shay or for the Heisler they were
              overhauling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>The finished sills for the model need to be about 1.125&quot;
              thick and 3&quot; high.&nbsp; Oak has a pretty course grain so I
              decided to find a closer grained hardwood such as maple or
              cherry.&nbsp; These are common hardwoods that are being actively
              logged in the area.&nbsp; However, the local lumber company didn't
              have any pieces in stock that would have a finished thickness of
              over an inch.&nbsp; So, put the sills on hold pending a visit to
              one of the local
              sawmills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            <td><b>How About Mahogany?:&nbsp; </b>I was doing some volunteer
              electronics training in Ghana (West Africa)&nbsp; in June, 2003, a
              short time after I started looking for suitable sill
              hardwood.&nbsp;&nbsp; I often walked by a furniture shop down
              the street from my hotel.&nbsp; The shop had a roof but otherwise
              was open air.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only hand tools were used.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Typical products were beds, chests, tables and chairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              One time I stopped and asked if they would sell me a couple pieces
              of the wood they were using.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp; selected a ~2x6&nbsp; and told the guys I wanted two
              pieces about 60 centimeters long.&nbsp;&nbsp; They got out the
              ruler and measured off ~ 21 inches.&nbsp; I started to laugh and explained
              that I wanted about 20 inches and mentally converted to metric since
              the country is metric.&nbsp; The guy said &quot;when your ruler
              says inches, you use inches&quot;.&nbsp; And yes, they always use
              the saw that way.</td>

      <p>This part of the project required much more effort than anticipated
      including the ~8000 mile trip to get the wood.</p>
      <p>Update: During the first test run at the track i found that the foot
      boards dragged on something so I raised then 1/2&quot; on both the tender
      and the mainframe.&nbsp; This adjustment was don by cutting 1/2&quot; off
      the top of the hanger and then using the remaining hole in each bracket as
      the top hole.&nbsp; A second lower hole was then drilled in each
      bracket.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
