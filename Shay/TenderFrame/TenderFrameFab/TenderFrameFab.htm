              were attached to the channels with screws
              and then the pieces were silver soldered together.&nbsp; The channels
              were cut about 1/16&quot; long and the ends milled to the
              correct length after the bolster was soldered together.&nbsp; This
              insured
              that the ends were
              square.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two 1/4&quot; thick plates were then attached to the ends

              angle brackets were positioned 0.020&quot; to 0.030&quot; back
              from the ends of the channels to make sure the the ends of the

      <p align="left"><b>Triangle Frame Brackets:&nbsp; </b>Considerable thought
      was given to a process to make the frame brackets.&nbsp; These brackets
      are merely decoration on the tender.&nbsp; However, they support the
      walkways on the main frame so a process to make uniform sturdy brackets was
      required.&nbsp;&nbsp; When making the corner brackets used between the
      channels it was learned that if those brackets were made to be a snug fit
      in the bottom of the channel U the the brackets keep the channels
      aligned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, if these triangle frame brackets are a
      tight fit in the channel U, they will be self aligning in the&nbsp; vertical
      position as well as being straight.&nbsp; So, that was a first
      requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next requirement was that the upper
      surface be even with the top of the channel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next
      requirement was that they look good with square ends, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      solution that worked was to make a fixture and use a carefully thought out
      process.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following shows the process that will also be
      used to make the main frame triangular brackets.&nbsp; (This process isn't
      ISO 900X certified yet, but it could be. )</p>

              bending was done in a vise with the metal sandwiched between scrap
              angles with sharp corners.&nbsp; The actual forming was done
              with a hammer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two legs of the angles were then cut to slightly&nbsp; over the correct
              width after the angle was formed.&nbsp; This was done
              with a saw.&nbsp; A piece of flat stock of the appropriate width
              was clamped into the angle as a saw guide.&nbsp; Each angle&nbsp; was
              then clamped into the mill and the edge finished to the proper leg
              width.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see the edge of angle between the left
              vise jaw in the photo on the right.&nbsp; The flat stock to the
