      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The tender
      frame was built before the main frame because it is smaller and much of it is hidden
      (which means the poor quality work and screw ups are hidden.)&nbsp; One
      thought was to try out some different methods before doing the main
      frame.&nbsp; In fact, the tender frame has evolved several times during
      this process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Kenneth welded his
      frame.&nbsp; One of my main concerns was
      that I'm not a very good welder.&nbsp; Some test welds were made on scrap
      pieces of channel.&nbsp; The welds were strong but the weld beads weren't uniform and
      there was splatter everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; A small wire
      welder with the flux in the wire was used.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acetylene might have worked
      better, but&nbsp; there is no way I could
      weld up a frame that matches the quality of the completed
      trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The prototype frame was
      riveted together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drive screws can be used&nbsp; like rivets
      and then everything silver soldered together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the
      drive screws don't hold very well before the joints are soldered.&nbsp;
      It's also nice to be able to take stuff apart and reassemble them during the
      fabrication process --- drive screws don't permit easy
      disassembly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another problem is that my sulfuric
      acid pickling solution eats the drive screws pretty
      quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Another concern is to make
      sure everything is solid&nbsp; -----&nbsp; don't want the rear coupler
      and sill to break off when the clutch is popped in low
      gear!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">In response to a question
      about accessing the pump in the tender tank Kenneth said the rivets in his
      tank top are decoration and didn't actually hold the top in place.&nbsp; He said every so often he used a
      <b><i>button head cap screw </i></b>instead of a rivet to hold the top in place.&nbsp; He said these screws are nearly indistinguishable from the
      rivets,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these screws are shown
      below.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="ButtonHeadScrews.JPG" width="168" height="79"></p>
      <p align="left">These screws came to mind later when trying to solve the tender frame problem.&nbsp;
      &nbsp; The 4-40 screw has a
      0.112&quot;&nbsp; diameter with a head diameter of 0.213&quot; and
      0.59&quot; height.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lima frame drawing&nbsp; shows all frame
      rivet holes were drilled 13/16&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; That scales to 13/128 =
      0.102&quot; ---- very close to the 4-40 screw diameter.&nbsp; The head
      diameter is probably pretty close to the rivet too.&nbsp;&nbsp; The socket
      is 1/16&quot; hex.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hole will be pretty well
      covered when the frame is painted.&nbsp; If it is a concern, the holes can be
      filled&nbsp; auto body putty before painting.&nbsp; These are exactly what
      was needed and it was decided to use these screws everyplace on the frames
      where rivet detail is required.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"> The plan at that point was to screw everything together and silver solder the four corner joints and the joint between
      the truck bolsters and the frame side channels.&nbsp; However, when everything
      was screwed together
      it was&nbsp; rigid.&nbsp; That was before the 1/8&quot; tender floor plate was attached&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the floor is there, it will
      really be rock solid.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result,&nbsp; the plan was changed again
      to&nbsp; just screw the channels together.&nbsp; It is really nice to be able
      to take everything apart to modify a piece if required.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some
      smaller parts were silver soldered to the major frame
      members.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Kenneth's major emphasis is the castings and he furnishes very
      detailed drawings on how they are to be machined.&nbsp;&nbsp; He<font size="3">
      also includes drawings for the frame, cab, tanks, etc. for the Shay he
      constructed.&nbsp; These drawings are an excellent resource.&nbsp;
      However.</font> I am not at all reluctant to deviate from the
      cosmetic aspects of his design.&nbsp; I am reluctant&nbsp; to
      change overall dimensions or to alter structural aspects without
      considerable thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the plan is to not weld the
      frame together, it was decided to learn more about how the prototype frame was riveted together.&nbsp;
      &nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="LimaTenderFrDwg.jpg" width="715" height="237"><p align="left">There
      was no tender drawing in the collection of Lima drawings obtained from
      Kenneth .&nbsp; There was a main frame drawing that closely matches the main frame
      design Kenneth used.&nbsp; The tender frame drawing above is from a
      reprint of an early Shay Spare Parts Book.&nbsp;&nbsp; This frame has
      internal channels that run parallel to the side channels.&nbsp; There are
      no internal channels in Kenneth's design.&nbsp; These internal
      channels&nbsp; are required on the prototype to support the heavy load of
      water.&nbsp; The initial plan was to not have the internal channels, but as
      the design evolved the final plan was to add the internal&nbsp; channels using only
      screws to hold them in place.&nbsp;&nbsp; This should help keep the ends from being pulled off.&nbsp;
      It is also reassuring since the tender
      must support the ~8 gal of water (64 pounds) and
      the engineer (assume 200 pounds).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align="left">Another
      thing changed from Kenneth's design is the height of the truck
      bolster.&nbsp; He uses 1 1/4&quot; high channels with the bottom in line
      with the bottom of the side channels.&nbsp; The top of his bolster is
      1/4&quot; below the top of the side channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is
      the standard arrangement for the bolsters on the main frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      It was decided to make the tender
      bolster the
      same height as the frame sides matching the drawing
      above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will permit a support under the middle of
      the tank floor plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align="left">Another difference between the drawing above and Kenneth's design is the&nbsp;
      curved end on the left that is between the the tender and the main
      frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a matching&nbsp; curved on the locomotive
      main frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cass
      No 5, Lima Number 1503, an 80 ton class C build in 1905 has similar
      curved ends as shown below.&nbsp; (It looks like someone left their lunch
      on the middle truck.&nbsp; I spent several hours climbing over that thing
      and never noticed the brown bag.)<p align="left"><img border="0" src="Cass5A.jpg" width="710" height="395"><p align="left">I'm
      modeling a locomotive of of the 1910-1912 era with Cass No 5 as the primary source for
      details.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; several areas will be different.&nbsp; The biggest difference is Cass No 5&nbsp; doesn't
      have the cast crankcase --- that was introduced a few years later. &nbsp; Note that there are no rivets on the tender
      tank.&nbsp; The original tank was probably replaced with a welded
      tank.&nbsp;&nbsp; The under frame supports are very close the Kenneth's
      drawings as is the rivet detail in the side frame member.&nbsp;<p align="left">The
      next two photos are of Cass No 2, Lima Number 3320, a 100 ton Class C
      built in 1928.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p>&nbsp;The left photo shows nice rivet detail on the tender and is
      likely what I'll use.&nbsp; The right photo is a close-up of the front end
      of the tender frame. The front frame member is straight, not curved and
      shows nice rivet detail.&nbsp; This closely matches Kenneth's drawings and
      is what I decided to use..&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p align="left">The final area of design interest is the rear frame member
      and the rear end sill.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photos below show the the rear end
      sills of&nbsp; Cass No 5 on left and Cass No 2 on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The plan is to use the rectangular end sill specified in Kenneth's drawings that closely
      matches the Cass No 5 in the left photo.&nbsp;

            <td valign="top">The frame end members are different between the
              main frame and the tender frame.&nbsp; The drawing on the right
              shows the rear of a Class B frame with the rear channel mounted
              low to line up with the coupler pocket.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the tender, the
              top of the channel is even with the top of the other frame members
              as shown on the right side of the first drawing. This is probably
              to give better support to the water tank.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
              decided&nbsp; to
              mount the rear channel high like the first drawing and install a bracket below the
              channel to attach the coupler pocket.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      <p align="left">The main pieces of the tender frame are the two sides, two
      ends, the bolster, the four internal channels and the floor plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach was to finish
      each of these pieces as completely as possible and then fasten the pieces
      all together.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next photo shows how the frame looked the
      first time it was assembled.<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Prelim.jpg" width="700" height="438">
      &nbsp;<p align="left">&nbsp;I was very pleased with the frame at this
      point.&nbsp; It was square and very rigid with less than 20% of the
      screws in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align="left">The only thing I didn't like was
      the frame brackets.&nbsp; The brackets&nbsp; looked good in terms
      of matching Kenneth's drawings.&nbsp; My concern was that they seemed
      out of proportion.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are a close match to the brackets
      shown on the Lima main frame drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess the biggest
      problem is that the bracket material is 1/8&quot; thick which would scale
      up to 1&quot; on the prototype.&nbsp; Since the brackets are positioned on
      top of the side channels, the floor plate will not make contact to the
      frame channels, it ill be 1/8&quot; above the
      channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p align="left">The prototype tender floor was made of wood planks that
      rested directly on the channels.&nbsp; The planks are easily identified in
      some of the Cass photos shown earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brackets
      don't support the planks but rather support an angle iron finishing piece under the
      outside edge on the planks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photos below&nbsp; show some
      additional views the brackets used on the Cass shays.&nbsp; The
      left photo shows the brackets on a Shay tender carcass that I assume
      is being used for spare parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brackets on this tender frame are steel triangles
      with angle iron attached on both sides of the top edge and both sides of
      the edge next to the frame.&nbsp; The right photo shows a bracket&nbsp; on
      the main frame of Cass No 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; This same style bracket is used
      on at least several of the Cass Shays.&nbsp; It
      appears that the angles were riveted to the triangles and in many cases
      the angles were also riveted to the frame channels.&nbsp; My guess is that
      if the
      brackets were removed for some reason, the were sometimes reattached using
      bolts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p align="left">The sample triangle bracket shown in the
      photos below was made to see how it looked. The bracket was made from scrap 0.035&quot;
      thick&nbsp; (20 gauge?) galvanized steel.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The rivets are #2 drive screws.&nbsp; The bracket is temporarily stuck to the frame with putty.&nbsp;&nbsp; The triangle bracket appears much
      smaller than the original bracket.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, both stick out the same
      distance from the frame.&nbsp; The right photo shows how it will look when
      the floor is in position.&nbsp; This look was appealing and it was decided
      to use the&nbsp; triangle type brackets on both the tender and main frames.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
