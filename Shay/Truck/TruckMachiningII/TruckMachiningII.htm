      <p align="left">After machining the Journal Boxes and
      Pedestals I then tackled the wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I discovered that
      the wheels were too large for my 3-jaw chuck but fitted nicely in the
      4-jaw chuck when the jaws were&nbsp; reversed.&nbsp; The left photo below
      shows centering a wheel casting in the chuck.&nbsp; The next step was to
      face the wheel as shown in the center photo below followed by turning the
      correct flange diameter as shown on the right
      below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p>The next operation was to make the hole for the axel.&nbsp; This
      operation required center drilling (left photo below),&nbsp; drilling an
      undersized hole (center photo) and then boring the hole to about
      0.010&quot; undersize. The boring operation created an exactly round and
      centered hole.</p>

      <p align="left">The final step was to ream the hole to the exact required
      size as shown below.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reamer shaft size was larger than any
      of my tailstock chucks&nbsp; so I used a center to keep it aligned and vise
      grips to keep the reamer from rotating.&nbsp; I then advance the tailstock
      to ream the hole.&nbsp; I sure hate to use vise grips on anything, but it was the
      easiest solution for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Wheel8.JPG" width="617" height="366">
      <p align="left">The next step was to reverse the wheel in the chuck and
      face the front and turn to the correct width.&nbsp; This was was done on
      all wheels before proceeding further.&nbsp; Next, a stub axel was turned
      and each wheel mounted on the axel and the wheel&nbsp; turned to the correct diameter
      and taper as shown in middle photo
      below.&nbsp; This was done on all wheels.&nbsp; Each wheel was mounted on
      the stub axel again and the flange was turned to the correct thickness and
      taper as shown in the right photo below.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, a file was used
      to round the edges.&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left"><b>The Gears:&nbsp; </b>Recall that a bevel gear is
      attached to each right wheel.&nbsp; Standard off-the-shelf gears are used
      but modified as shown below.&nbsp; First a recess is bored in each
      gear.&nbsp; The photo on the left below shows an unmodified gear beside a
      gear with the recess.&nbsp; The square boss on the RH Journal Box fits in
      this recess.&nbsp; The next step&nbsp; was to cut down the length of the
      shoulder on the gear.&nbsp; The right photo below shows gears with and
      with out the reduced shoulder length.&nbsp;&nbsp; The gears are made of a
      very fine quality steel&nbsp; that machines easily and gives a very smooth
      surface.&nbsp; Obviously, these are unhardened versions of the
      gears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p align="left"><b>Cutting Keyways:&nbsp; </b>Keys are used between
      the&nbsp; wheels and gears and the axels to insure they all turn
      together.&nbsp; A broach is used to cut the keyway in the wheels and
      gears.&nbsp; I'd never used a broach before so the operation was
      novel.&nbsp; The broach is shown in the photo below.&nbsp; The notched bar
      is the actual broach.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cylinder is a sleeve with the same
      diameter as the hole in the wheel and gear.&nbsp;&nbsp; The little bent
      piece is a shim.<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Broach1.JPG" width="704" height="275">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align="left">The
      broaching operation is shown in the left photo below.&nbsp; In this case
      I'm cutting the keyway in a wheel and gear together.&nbsp; (The thickness
      of the hole in the gear is small making it difficult to keep the broach
      perpendicular to the gear face.&nbsp; This is not a problem with the much
      thicker wheel and doing a wheel and gear at the same time worked
      well.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The sleeve is placed&nbsp; in the hole and the broach
      then pressed though the slot in the sleeve. Each succeeding tooth on the
      broach is slightly longer and takes a small cut in the gear and
      wheel.&nbsp;&nbsp; One pass of the broach cuts a slot exactly half the
      required depth. The little shim is then inserted in the slot in the sleeve
      and the broach pressed through again to double the slot depth.&nbsp; The
      finished slots in the gear and wheel are show on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Sure beats trying to file a slot!

      <p align="left">The gear is attached to the wheel with four flathead
      screws.&nbsp;&nbsp; The easiest way I could figure to drill the holes was
      to make a template as shown in the left photo below.&nbsp;&nbsp; A keyway
      was cut in the stub axel used to turn the wheels and it was placed in a
      drill press vise.&nbsp; A gear and the template was then slid on the axel
      and the four holes started in the gear.&nbsp; The gear was removed and the
      holes drilled through.&nbsp; The wheel and the gear were then mounted on
      the stub axel together and the gear used as a template for the holes in
      the wheel as shown o the right..&nbsp;&nbsp; The wheel holes were tapped,
      the holes in the gear were enlarged to the clearance size and counter
      sunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
