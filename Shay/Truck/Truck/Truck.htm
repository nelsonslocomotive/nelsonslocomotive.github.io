      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The starting point for the
      trucks was the castings purchased from Kenneth Schroeder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      photo below shows the castings for one of the three trucks.&nbsp; Not show
      are the castings for the brake system which I plan to discuss in a separate
      part.&nbsp; <b>Note: Later, when I made the line shafts and universals I
      decided to change the trucks slightly.&nbsp;&nbsp; This change is included
      at the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;The </font>upper left two castings
      are the LH Journal Boxes.&nbsp; The upper right two castings are the RH
      Journal Boxes.&nbsp; The two castings in the middle of the upper row are
      the Pedestals. The four castings in the bottom row are, of course, the
      wheels.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The first thing I did was to machine all the castings to the correct dimensions.&nbsp;
      The next thing was to cut, drill, thread and shape the many required flat
      pieces.&nbsp; The final step was&nbsp; to assemble everything.&nbsp; I'm going to
      concentrate on the various parts and how they all fit together in this note.
      There is&nbsp; information on the machining and fabrication of the various parts in
      the accompanying Shay Truck&nbsp; Machining notes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              side frames of one truck are shown on the right.&nbsp; The upper
              group is for the left side frame and the lower group is for the
              right side frame.&nbsp; The two sides are different because the drive shaft
              and&nbsp; gears between the drive shaft and axels are on the right
              side.&nbsp; The Journal Box castings have been machined at this
              point.&nbsp; The
              remaining parts are made from steel sheet, bar and angle
              stock.&nbsp; The blocks that hold the bearings in the LH Journal
              Boxes (upper part of photo) are machined from aluminum stock &nbsp;
              <p>The assembled side frames are shown below.&nbsp; I was a little
              too close when I took these two photos which caused the bars to appear
              distorted.&nbsp; As you will see in the later photos, those pieces
              of angle are not curved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              line shafts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The axels were made from cold
              finished steel bar.&nbsp; The bronze disk is an eccentric used to drive
              a pump that feeds water from the tender to the boiler.&nbsp; This
              eccentric is provided on only one axel.
              <p>The assembled axels are shown in the lower left photo and the
              assembled axel - side frames are shown on the lower right.&nbsp;
              There is a ball bearing in each Journal Box.&nbsp; The nuts on each

              plank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pedestal castings on each end are
              attached to the bottom spring plank.&nbsp; The top spring plank is
              above the springs and free to move up and down between the
              pedestals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The springs push the top plank
              up.&nbsp; There are two screws from the top plank to the bottom plank
              that limit the the upward motion&nbsp; of the top spring
              plank.&nbsp; One of these screws is visible to the right of the
              left most two springs.&nbsp; The screw at the other end is partially
              hidden by a spring.</p>

        <p align="left">This is the completed set of three trucks.<center><img border="0" src="3Trucks.jpg" width="700" height="342">
      </center><p align="left"><b>What's missing?&nbsp; </b>I decided to call
      the trucks finished at this stage, clean up the workshop and move on to the
      next part of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following four areas will be
      completed later:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b>Water Pump:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The water pump must be
          built and installed on the middle truck.&nbsp; That will be done with
          the rest of the feed water system.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b>Pivot Block &amp; Rollers:</b>&nbsp; The connection
          between the frame and trucks is via a pivot block mounted to the top spring plank.&nbsp;
          The frame is stabilized by rollers also mounted on the top spring
          plank.&nbsp; The pivot block and rollers will be fabricated when the
          frame is constructed.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b>Line Shaft and Pinion Gears:</b>&nbsp; As mentioned
          previously, the line shaft and pinion gears are mounted to the right
          journal boxes.&nbsp; These will be constructed as part of the drive
          shaft - universal - line shaft system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b>Brakes: </b>The brakes are also mounted to the
          trucks and are operated by a steam driven brake cylinder mounted to
          the frame.&nbsp; I had
          intended to put off the brakes until everything else had been built
          and, running.&nbsp; However, after observing how easily the the trucks
          roll, even with considerable load and recognizing that my track will
          have over 5% grades, I decided brakes are a necessity.&nbsp; I plan to
          build the brake system after the frame is finished and mounted on the
          trucks. </li>
      </ol>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;The trucks weigh 27 pounds each at
      this point.&nbsp; When all the missing pieces are installed, the weight
      will likely increase to about 30 pounds.&nbsp;

            <td><b>Modification:&nbsp; </b>Some months after making the trucks I
              added the line shafts and universals.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to use
              a slightly larger diameter universal ring than specified by
              Kenneth.&nbsp; This in turn caused interference with the lower tie
              bar.&nbsp; To eliminate the interference I moved all the lower tie
              bars from above the angles to below the angles as shown on the
              right.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to cut out&nbsp; a section of the
              vertical side of the angle as seen in the photo.&nbsp; The tie
              bars had already been drilled for a clearance hole so a nut was
              required on the attachment screws.&nbsp; (Maybe some day I'll make
              new tie bars with tapped holes.)&nbsp; A flat head screw is used
              in locations directly under the universal rings to provide
              additional clearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
