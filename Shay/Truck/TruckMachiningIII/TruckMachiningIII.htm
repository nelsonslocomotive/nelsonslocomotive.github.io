            <td valign="top">The photo shows the assembled flat bars for one
              truck.&nbsp; A total of 16 bars, consisting of 12 flat bars, 2
              bent flat bars (side bar hangers) and 2 angles are required for
              each truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kenneth's drawings call for Hot Rolled
              Steel.&nbsp; I decided to use Cold Finished Steel stock for all&nbsp;
              except the angles which are available only in HRS.&nbsp; The
              CFS has a much smoother surface and squarer cross section.
              <p>There are a total of 9 different lengths and/or drilling
              patterns in each truck.&nbsp; Since I was making three trucks I
              decided to make a pattern for each of the 9 bar
              variations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The accuracy of the lengths of the bars
              and the hole patterns have a significant impact on the quality of
              the finished truck so I was very critical of the patterns and in
              fact redid several until I had a satisfactory set.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <p align="left">I was very concerned about my ability to fabricate
      satisfactory side bar hangers ---- the part with the bends.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The hanger is made from 1/4&quot; X 1/2&quot; flat bar stock.&nbsp; The
      drawings&nbsp; suggest that the bar be sawed halfway through at each bend
      point, heated red hot at that point and then bent.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
      procedure worked very well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo below shows the first
      attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bent hanger is attached the top strap
      to make sure the length of the hanger is correct.&nbsp; (The top strap
      appears to be slightly bowed in the photo.&nbsp; This is probably do to
      positioning the camera too close to the object.)&nbsp; The angles on the
      two sides of the strap were adjusted until they were equal.&nbsp;

            <td width="50%" valign="top">The drawings indicate that the gaps at
              the bend points be filled by brazing.&nbsp; My gas welding tanks
              were empty and the weather was bad so I decided to use my little
              flux-core wire welder to fill the gaps.&nbsp; (I used a propane
              burner to heat the bars for bending.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flux
              core welding made a mess but produced very strong
              joints.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to do 2 or 3 passes on each joint to get
              a satisfactory buildup..&nbsp; The joints were ground flat and
              cleaned between each pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final finishing
              was done with a file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>I was very relieved when I had the 6 bars shown on the right
              completed.&nbsp;</td>

      <p align="left">The condition of the ends of the bars have a major impact on the overall
      truck appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sloppy ends look really bad. &nbsp; I'm unable to saw bars with smooth square ends and
      correct lengths.&nbsp; What works for me is to saw the bars about
      1/8&quot; longer than required on my 14&quot; abrasive cutoff saw ($60
      from Harbor Freight) and then finish the ends to make them square and the
      bars the correct length.&nbsp; I finished some ends in the lathe and some
      in the mill.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mill is probably the quickest.&nbsp; I was
      able to put up to about 8 bars together in the milling vise so the
      operation is fairly quick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had purchased a four fluted
      doubled ended 1/2&quot;&nbsp; diameter Chinese end mill from Enco for
      $3.49 (probably about $5 when S&amp;H included).&nbsp; I was able to
      finish all the bar and spring plank ends for the three trucks using one
      end of the double ended end mill.&nbsp; It's getting pretty dull now so
      will start using the other end when I work on the frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align="left">The
      ends of the cross braces are cut at 24.5 degrees and 65.5 degrees.&nbsp; I
      spent considerable time on my afternoon walks thinking about how to do a
      good job of finishing these ends.&nbsp; I have a rotary table that I can
      mount on the mill, but it is a big pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; It finally dawned on
      me that the ends are square and at&nbsp; right angles with respect to the
      truck side frames.&nbsp; It was then a simple matter to make a fixture
      from scrap 1/2&quot; angle with two holes the same distance apart as the
      cross brace mounting holes in the side frames.&nbsp;&nbsp; The left photo
      below show a pair of cross braces mounted to the fixture.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
      rough sawed the excess length from the ends when attached to the fixture
      (this allowed fairly accurate rough cuts) and then did the finish cut in
      the mill as shown on the right.&nbsp; That's the $3.49 end mill at work.

            <td valign="top">Kenneth's drawings call for the spring planks to be
              made by welding two channels and two flat bars together as shown on
              the top right.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the welding the top and bottom are
              to
              be smoothed by machining or grinding.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not much of a
              welder so that didn't seem like such a good idea to me.&nbsp;
              <p>I had purchased a set of Lima Locomotive Works drawings from
              Kenneth so I thought I'd take a look at the
              prototype.&nbsp; The spring plank is show on a 1923 blueprint.&nbsp;
              I&nbsp; was able to scan part of that blueprint and
              &quot;process&quot; the image to get the lower part of the sketch on the
              right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that they welded the 3/8&quot; plates on
              the top and bottom to get smooth surfaces.&nbsp; Kenneth must be complimented
              on a design that very closely approximates the prototype
              profile&nbsp; from
              readily available stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <p align="left">In spite of the nice profile of the welded channels/flat
      bars I decided to use CFS stock to make my spring planks. The top and
      bottom are 1/8&quot; X 1 1/2&quot; flat bars and the center part is a
      3/4&quot; X 1&quot; bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rough cut stock for one top
      and one bottom spring plank are shown on the right.&nbsp;<p align="left"><b>Update:
      Some time after I finished the trucks, I visited Mike Mihalyi who is
      building a pair of Shays.&nbsp;&nbsp; He used a different spring plank
      design based on Ken's earlier drawings.&nbsp; He used a pair of 1&quot; X
      1/2&quot; X 1/8&quot; channels instead of the 3/4&quot; X 1&quot; solid
      bars I used.&nbsp; He screwed the 1/8&quot; X 1 1/2&quot; bars to the top
      and bottom of these channels.&nbsp; This is like the Lima drawing without
      the two 6&quot;-15 1/2&quot; channels on the inside.&nbsp; If I make
      another Shay I'll use that design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><p align="left">The
      next step was to locate and drill a 1/2' hole in each piece.&nbsp; (This
      is
      the hole that provides access to the lower screw in the&nbsp; pivot
      block.)&nbsp; A bolt though this hole was used to hold everything
      together&nbsp; and aligned while other holes are drilled for flat head
      screws to hold everything together.&nbsp;

              notch by sawing.&nbsp; The end mill provided the final finished
              surface. That's the $3.49 end mill at work.&nbsp; The socket
              head cap screw is in the hole that will later be used for one of

              together, I drilled the holes in the bottom spring plank and
              then used it as a template to drill the pedestal as shown in the

              enabled the pedestals to be positioned and all dimensions verified

              photo at right shows milling the slot. And, that's not the
              $3.49 end mill.&nbsp; That's a single ended 5/16&quot; end mill
              which cost $1.99. The slot is about 3/8&quot; wide.&nbsp; Two cuts
              were required.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mill height was adjusted slightly
              above the centerline of the spring plank.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a first cut, the
              spring plank was turned over and a second cut taken.&nbsp; This
              technique assured that the slot centerline was on the spring
              plank centerline.</td>
