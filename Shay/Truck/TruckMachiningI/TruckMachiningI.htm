      <p align="left">I mentioned elsewhere that my limited machining
      skills are self taught.&nbsp;&nbsp; This leads me to frequently do things
      the hard way.&nbsp; Often I use a cumbersome technique that I'm pretty
      sure I can do rather than trying a new way.&nbsp; This reminds me of a
      comment by a friend after I was critical of people using a much less than&nbsp;
      optimal software tool because they understood that tool.&nbsp; My friend
      observed that if your only tool is a hammer, most your tasks begin to look
      like nails.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please view my techniques from this perspective.<p align="left">The
      truck castings consisted of two pedestals, four journal boxes and four
      wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather that describe how I machined each type of
      casting, I decided to
      discuss the RH Journal Boxes&nbsp; and the Wheels in detail&nbsp; and skip the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      This note deals with the Journal Boxes.&nbsp; The wheels are discussed in
      a separate note.<p align="left">.

              casting is shown on the right.&nbsp; This is exactly as I received
              the casting from Kenneth except that the sprue has been sawed
              off.&nbsp; (The dark rectangle on the top is where the sprue was
              sawed off.)

      <p align="left">.So how did I get from the rough casting to the finished
      casting?&nbsp; Well, I following the instructions in the drawing below.&nbsp; This is one of the 85 drawings that Kenneth makes available
      to show how the castings should be machined.&nbsp; I bought the drawing
      set that also includes three pages of photos before I bought the
      castings.&nbsp; This enabled me to judge whether I could actually do the
      machining before I laid out the big bucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drawing
      is presented here with Kenneth's permission.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p align="left"><img border="0" src="Dwg7.jpg" width="720" height="563"><p align="left">The
      first thing I did was to examine the rough casting and the drawing and try
      to visualize where material had to be removed from the
      casting.&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of fooling around with it for at least 30
      minutes spread over a couple days, I didn't notice the curved recesses in
      the top until I was ready to mount the castings to the side frames.&nbsp;
      These recesses are clearly shown in the view in the upper left corner of
      the drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, I didn't overlook anything that
      caused me to remove material where I shouldn't have.

            <td valign="top">The first thing I did to&nbsp; the Journal Boxes was
              to take a very fine cut on the bottom as shown on the left and a
              very fine cut to the top as shown on the right. The rough cast
              front and back surfaces were used as the
              reference.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These fine cuts provided smooth
              reference surfaces for future measurements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These
              cuts were made on all 6 Journal Boxes before moving on to the next
              step. </td>

            <td valign="top">The next thing was to take a light cut on the front
              face as suggested in the drawing above.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is shown on
              the left.&nbsp; I used a fly cutter.&nbsp;&nbsp; This cut was made
              on all six Journal boxes.
              <p>The cut was then taken on the back to achieve the 1.56&quot; dimension.&nbsp;
              Once the correct cutter height was set on the first box it was very
              easy to do the other five boxes.</p>

            <td valign="top">At this point the top, bottom, front and back of
              each box was smooth.&nbsp; The overall height was still too large
              and would be adjusted later.&nbsp; Each box was examined to
              determine the center of the square boss and relate it to the
              height of the centerline through the bearing.&nbsp; It was found
              that the bearing center line could be in the middle of the square
              boss and material could be removed later from the base to achieve the
              correct bearing centerline height.&nbsp; A hole was then drilled
              through the center square boss of each Journal Box.&nbsp; This
              hole was the same size as a large center
              drill.&nbsp; The center drill was then inserted in the hole and
              used to align the box in the four-jaw lathe chuck such that the
              hole was on the lathe center as shown on the right.
              <p>The hole through the box was then enlarged with a 5/8&quot;
              drill (Silver &amp; Deming) as shown on the left below.&nbsp; The
              hole was then bored to the correct stepped diameter as shown in the
              center photo below.&nbsp; The bearing was tested for a loose fit
              in the larger diameter hole.&nbsp; The last step was to cut the
              groove for internal retaining ring using a boring bar with a very
              narrow tool bit as shown on the right below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All
              these operations were completed on each box before it was removed
              from the chuck.</td>

      <p align="left"><b>Cover Plates: </b>When I started to write this note I discover
      that I didn't have photos dealing with the cover plates for the RH Journal
      Boxes but did have some for the LH Journal Boxes so decided to use
      them.&nbsp; The same technique was used on both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align="left">I've
      always had trouble making square plates&nbsp; with straight edges.&nbsp;
      The technique that works for me is to saw the plates a little oversize and
      square them up in the mill as shown in the left photo below.&nbsp; I next
      very carefully marked off and drilled the holes in one of the
      plates.&nbsp; This plate was then used as a pattern to drill the holes in
      the other five plates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each plate was then used as a
      pattern to drill the holes in the Journal Boxes.&nbsp; I carefully positioned
      a plate on a journal box and drilled one hole as shown in right photo
      below.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then tapped that hole&nbsp; and used a screw to
      secure the plate.&nbsp; Once secured,&nbsp; the plate was used as a pattern to
      drill the other five holes.&nbsp;
