      <p>Two tanks are used on the Shay, a water tank and a fuel tank.&nbsp; I'm
      planning to burn oil so both tanks are functional.&nbsp; My experience working with sheet metal has
      been mostly bad so I was not anxious to build the tanks.&nbsp; In fact there
      were many interesting things to work on such as the water pumps, brake
      cylinder, etc.&nbsp; However, the tanks were beginning to loom over my
      head so though it best to get to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once started,&nbsp; it
      turned out not so bad ---- in other words, a tank
      fabrication process that made it difficult to screw them up was developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <td valign="top"><p><b>Research:&nbsp;</b>The first step was to
              decide on how to piece the sides and the rivet detail.&nbsp; Kenneth
              fabricated the rounded corners and then riveted the four sides to
              the corners.&nbsp; That's a lot of rivets but it also insures the
              sides are square with the corners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a photo
              of Ken's tanks on the right.</p>

            <td>The tender tanks on the Cass shays had been photographed on previous visits
              in
              anticipation of building tanks.&nbsp; None of the
              tanks on the Cass Shays are the same.&nbsp; Also, probably none
              are original, so one has a lot of latitude here.&nbsp; The
              tank on Shay No 5 has no rivets, it's welded construction.&nbsp;
              All of the Cass Shays burn coal so all have coal bunkers
              instead of fuel tanks.
              <p>The photos on right show the tender tank on Cass Shay No
              6.&nbsp;&nbsp; One piece of steel is used on the sides and
              back.&nbsp; There has to be a seam in the front but I failed the
              photograph that seam.&nbsp; There is a close spaced row of rivets
              at upper and lower edges to attach sides to the top and bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also staggered vertical rows of
              rivets that attach internal
              supports.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            <td>On Cass No 2., the tank sides and rounded corners are single
              pieces with the flat ends riveted to the sides.&nbsp; This has the
              same close spaced rows of rivets to attach the top and bottom as
              Shay No 6.&nbsp; The rivets
              attaching the internal braces are in a straight vertical row
              rather a staggered row as on Shay 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              There is also a close spaced row of rivets around the outer edge of the
              top ----&nbsp; I think they're hidden by dust and dirt on the
              top.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>I decided to make my tanks like Cass No 2 tanks.&nbsp; For the
              water tank, will use four pieces: two sides with the corner
              bends&nbsp; and two
              ends.&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be four internal&nbsp; vertical braces
              on each side and one on each end.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the fuel tank I
              decided to make the front, two sides and four corners from one
              piece and the back from a second piece.&nbsp; There will be one
              vertical brace on each side and the rear and two braces in the
              front.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <p><b>Rivets:&nbsp; </b>The rivet heads on Cass Shay No 6 are 0.95 inches
      diameter. The rivets in the rows along the top and bottom are spaced on
      1.6 inch centers.&nbsp; For 1/8 scale, this scales to a 0.119 inch head
      and 0.2 inch spacing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was soon learned that you buy rivets based
      on shank diameter, shank length and head style --- sort of like machine
      screws.&nbsp; However, the head diameter was most important so went to
      Internet and found the following specification for small round head rivets
      ( jay-cee sales &amp; rivets, inc --- <a href="http://www.rivetsinstock.com" target="_blank">www.rivetsinstock.com</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p>This says 1/16 inch shank diameter rivets are required.&nbsp; None of my
      normal suppliers carried 1/16&quot; diameter rivets.&nbsp;
      The smallest Coles lists is 3/32&quot; diameter.&nbsp; Ken
      Schroeder told me to use copper rivets; the brass rivets are too hard to
      bend over.&nbsp;&nbsp; jay-cee sales had 1/16&quot; brass rivets, but no
      1/16&quot; copper rivets.&nbsp; (I tried some of the brass rivets and Ken
      is right, they're too hard.&nbsp; Reminds me of something a female colleague
      once said: 1 in 20 men will listen to good advice, the other 19 will go ahead
      and pee on an
      electric fence.) &nbsp; Found one place with 1/16&quot;
      diameter 1/4&quot; length copper rivets at $20/500.&nbsp; That seemed
      high.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally used search engine&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dogpile.com">www.dogpile.com</a>
      to find Hanson Rivet (<a href="http://www.hansonrivet.com">www.hansonrivet.com</a>/).&nbsp;&nbsp; They carry 1/16&quot; diameter 1/8&quot; long copper round head rivets for
      $34/pound.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      A pound has over 4,000 rivets so that looked like the best deal.&nbsp; The
      sales person was very nice.... suspect he normally sells in
      lots of tens or hundreds of pounds but was happy to sell me a pound and
      accepted payment via credit card.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Tank Material &amp; Construction: </b>Kenneth suggests using brass
      or galvanized steel for the tanks--- 22 gauge for the sides and bottom and
      18 gauge steel for the top.&nbsp; He also suggests bending some 1/2&quot;
      X 1/2&quot; angles from the side material to rivet to sides and ends to
      support top and bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp; After digesting this I sent a list of
      questions to Kenneth.&nbsp; As to the material, he said he's used both
      brass and steel and been happy with both.&nbsp; He did note that the water
      tank is subject to corrosion so if steel is used, it should be galvanized
      and it would probably be a good idea to paint the inside with one of the
      epoxy paints made to seal water tanks.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also questioned
      whether the water tank would support a fat (180 pound)&nbsp;
      engineer.&nbsp; He said he's had a much bigger engineer than that on his
      shay and no problem.&nbsp; As for the soft soldering, he uses acid core
      solder, an acid flux and a large electric soldering iron.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Bending Tool:&nbsp;</b> I then reviewed several of Kozo Hiraoka's books
      (<u>Building the Shay</u>, <u> Building the Heisler </u> and <u> Building the
      Climax</u>) for tank
      construction techniques.&nbsp; For his 3/4&quot; scale Heisler tank he used 1/16&quot; (16
      gauge) brass for the sides so maybe I should go a little heavier than the
      22 gauge Ken suggested.&nbsp; Hiraoka suggests a really neat tool to make the
      corner bends ---- this was a breakthrough for me.&nbsp; Ken suggested
      forming the corners around a piece of 1/2&quot; pipe but I couldn't see how
      to do that with any precision.&nbsp; Hiraoka's technique&nbsp; was to use
      a couple bolts to draw a piece of angle against the round forming
      piece with the sheet metal in between&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <div align="center">

          <tr>
            <td valign="top">Here's my crude version of Hiraoka's&nbsp; --- that's 1/2&quot; (0.825&quot; OD) pipe, 1''X 1/8&quot;
              angle and 1/4&quot; bolts.&nbsp; I tested it on both 22 gauge steel
              (pictured here) and also on 18 gauge steel with excellent results
              on both.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>(Note the corrosion on the steel.&nbsp; This was after I
              returned from a few weeks volunteer work in Africa.&nbsp; When I
              was gone the spouse decided that it was a good time to clean up
              the workshop so she scrubbed and painted the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Apparently she also used a damp cloth to remove the dust from the
              sheet steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait till she goes away for a few days
              --- I'm going to clean up her sewing room for her ---- using the sand
              blaster!)</p>
              <p>The bolts were later welded to the angle to make it easier to
              use. &nbsp; As we'll see, these bolts will need some
              additional attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <p>After making a few test bends I realized that the round corners are
      very forgiving --- the corner can actually be moved slightly if
      necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; This capability led me to the basic construction
      technique ---&nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Drill all the holes for the rivets and install rivets
      (except near the bends).</li>
        <li>Install internal braces.</li>
        <li>Make bends.</li>
        <li>Join sides and ends to form a band.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Cut top and bottom just fit into the band--- making sure pieces and
          hence sides are square.</li>
        <li>Solder the inner top and bottom into place.&nbsp;</li>
      </ol>
      The plan is to use two tops.&nbsp; The inner top is soldered into
      place to provide rigidity.&nbsp; This inner top has a large hole in the
      center to provide access to the inside of the tank.&nbsp; The second or
      outer top is
      slightly smaller, sets over the inner top&nbsp; and is held into place by a few button head screws (fake rivets).&nbsp;
      The outer top provides the seal and has the finished appearance.&nbsp;
      <p>OK, what about all the rivets?&nbsp; The rivets that join the ends of
      the sides and the end pieces will actually function as rivets.&nbsp; The same
      for the rivets that go into the vertical reinforcement angles.&nbsp; The
      rest of the rivets, specifically the rows along the top and bottom of the
      sides are there for decoration only --- I'll solder them to hold them in
      place and also seal the holes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rivets around around the outside edge of the removable
      top are also for decoration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="left"><b>Geometry: </b>One of the first tasks is to determine the dimensions
    of each piece.&nbsp; The rounded corners complicate things a bit as
    shown in diagram below.&nbsp; The curved section starts a distance of one half
    the diameter of the curvature back from the corner as shown on left&nbsp;&nbsp; I think of each side or end piece ending at the center of
    the rounder corner because that is where I need to place a mark to line up
    the bending fixture.&nbsp;&nbsp; The distance from the start of the curve to the
    center of the rounded part is one eighth the circumference of the round form
    or <span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="3">p</font></span>
    D/8 or 3.14 D/8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that the length of the side is
    reduced by the factor [D/2 -&nbsp; 3.14 D/8] at each end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This factor can be rewritten as 0.107 D.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm using&nbsp;
    1/2&quot; pipe for the curved form.&nbsp; The diameter of my pipe is 0.825
    inches so the factor 0.107D is 0.88&quot;.&nbsp; I rounder that up to
    3/32&quot; which will make the tank slightly smaller (and also increase the
    probably that the base will be a tight fit or have to be cut
    down).</p>

    <p align="left">The tanks are 7&quot; high and 12.125&quot;&quot;
    wide.&nbsp; They mount on floors that are 12.375&quot; wide so there's
    only 0.125&quot; margin on each side --- not much room for error ---and I'd
    already cut the floors.&nbsp; Then I started to wonder whether I should take
    into account the thickness of the material.&nbsp; To be safe I decided to
    use a width dimension of 12&quot; and assume it's the inside dimension of
    the tank.&nbsp; I was less concerned with the length of the tanks
    (22.5&quot; for the water tank and 7&quot; for the fuel tank) since there is
    plenty of margin in that direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><b>Marking off the fuel tank sides &amp; ends:&nbsp;</b>
    Kenneth suggests that the seams for the end pieces be about 1&quot; from the
    corners.&nbsp; The tanks are 12&quot; wide so I decided to make the end
    pieces 10&quot; long, hence the end pieces are 7&quot; X 10&quot;
    pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fuel tank is 12&quot; wide and 7&quot;
    long.&nbsp; Recall that I decided to make only one end piece --- at the
    back.&nbsp;&nbsp; The total distance around the tank if the corners were
    square would be 38&quot;.&nbsp; Because of the rounding, each end of the
    sides and ends are shortened by 3/32&quot; inch or a total of 8 times 3/32
    inches or 3/4&quot; making the total distance around the tank
    37.25&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to lap each joint by 1/4&quot; so
    there requires an additional 1/2&quot; for the two laps.&nbsp; The end is
    10&quot; wide so the other piece must be 37.25&quot; - 10&quot;(for the end
    piece) +
    .5&quot;(for the laps) = 27.75&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The layout for that piece
    is shown
    below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p><b>Marking off the water tank sides:&nbsp;</b>The water tank is
    22.75&quot; long, 12&quot; wide and 7&quot; high, the same width and height
    as the fuel tank.&nbsp; The end pieces are 7&quot; X 10&quot;, the same as
    the back piece of the fuel tank.&nbsp; I used a technique similar to that
    for the fuel tank above to compute the length of the sides with corners to
    be 24.875&quot;&nbsp; The layout for the sides is shown below.</p>

    <p><b>Sheet Metal List:&nbsp; </b>After all these computations I was able to
    make up the material list for the steel store.&nbsp; Kenneth had suggested 22
    gauge for the sides and bottom and 16 gauge for the top.&nbsp; I decided to
    use galvanized steel and make things a bit heavier: 20 gauge for the sides and
    ends and 14 gauge for the top and bottom.&nbsp; The complete list is:</p>
    <p>20 Gauge galvanize:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    3 pieces 7&quot; X 10&quot; (the ends)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    1 piece 7&quot; X 27.75&quot; (fuel tank sides and end)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    2 pieces 7&quot; X 24.875&quot; (water tank sides) (These dimensions were 
    corrected 12/27/08) <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    ~10 linear feet of 1/2&quot;X1/2&quot; angle bent from this same material
    (for internal reinforcing)&nbsp;</p>
    <p>14 gauge galvanized steel:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    3 pieces 12.125&quot; X 7&quot; (fuel tank bottom and tops - slightly
    oversize)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    3 pieces 12.125&quot; X 22.75&quot; (water tank bottom and tops - slightly
    oversize)</p>
    <p>I faxed the order to steel store in the morning and then visited
    Mill Creek Central RR to learn about track work.&nbsp; Spent most the day
    learning about cutting ties and stopped by steel store on way home.&nbsp;
    They were just about to start the cutting.&nbsp; Man do they have a big
    shear ---&nbsp;&nbsp; hydraulically operated --- can handle a 13 foot cut of
    1/2&quot; thickness&nbsp; ---- if I only had more room my shop.......</p>
    <p>They cut everything as ordered; the pieces were to the correct dimensions
    and square.&nbsp; One difference from the order -- they didn't have the 20
    gauge so they used a larger gauge.&nbsp; When I got home I found the sides
    and ends were 0.56&quot; thick.&nbsp; That's 17 gauge --- but maybe it's 18
    gauge with 3 or 4 thousands of galvanize coating on each side.&nbsp; Wow ---
    I forgot about the thickness of the galvanize; sure glad I decided to make
    that 1/8&quot; reduction in the width of the tanks!&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Rivet Hole Templates: </b>There are about 700 rivets in the fuel tank
    and about 1300 in the water tank so I'm not about to try marking off and center
    punching that many holes ----- after the first few,&nbsp; there'd be a
    staggered row.&nbsp; The solution of course is to make a set of drilling
    templates using the indexing capability of the mill table.&nbsp;
    Three templates are needed as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Holes centered 0.125&quot; from the edge for the lower row on the
        sides and ends and the edges of&nbsp; the lap joints.&nbsp; The hole spacing for this template is
        0.2&quot; (5 per inch).</li>
      <li>Holes centered 0.625&quot; from the edge for the upper row on the sides
        and ends.&nbsp; The hole spacing for this template is also 0.2&quot; (5 per
        inch).</li>
      <li>Holes in a row perpendicular to the edge starting at&nbsp; 0.5&quot; from the edge and ending
        6.125&quot; from the edge for the vertical reinforcing
        braces.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The hole spacing for this template is
        0.375&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

      <p>The fuel tank at this point is a success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The galvanized
      steel&nbsp; worked great; glad I used it rather than brass.&nbsp;
      The soldering went much easier than expected with the solder adhering
      very well if the joint is fluxed.&nbsp; The Ruby Flux tends to not wet the
      surface very well when cold but when heated it flows and
      coats the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 50/50 solder (50% tin/50% lead) worked
      very well too.&nbsp; (With the use of lead in the solder it's probably
      wise to not drink the water from the
      water tank&nbsp; --- same goes for the oil in the fuel tank.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The steel does solder differently than brass or
      copper because it's a poorer conductor&nbsp; --- it's easier to get a
      small point of solder to flow and more difficult to get a large section
      like a few inches of a seam to flow all at once.</p>

            and rubber sealing washer between the elbow and the bottom of the

            elbow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output pipe is 1/4&quot; tubing soft
            soldered into the end of the valve.&nbsp; A length of 1/4&quot; ID
            hose will be slipped over the end of the tube when the tank is

    <p>This is a good point to end this section.&nbsp; Still need to make the
    outer top with the hatch.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will do that as well as show the construction of the water tank in the next part.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The control valve and output to the burner will be shown in the burner
    page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
