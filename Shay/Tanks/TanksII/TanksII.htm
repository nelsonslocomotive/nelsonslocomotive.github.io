    <P>The basic fuel tank was fabricated in Part I.&nbsp; The outer top and a finishing strip around the upper edge,
    fill hole and outlet pipe are required to
      complete that tank.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than finish the fuel tank I decided to bring the water tank to
      the same point as fuel tank and then finish both.&nbsp;</P>
    <P><b>Water Tank:</b>&nbsp; I already had a good start on the water tank because all the holes in the
    end pieces had been drilled using the fuel tank end piece as a
    drilling template.&nbsp; The next step&nbsp; was to drill the holes in the
    side pieces.&nbsp; Since the two sides are identical, they were tack soldered together
    so that all the holes could
    be drilled at the same time.&nbsp; It turned out that one side was slightly
    taller than the other so that after the two were soldered together, the edge
    of the high one was&nbsp; was filed down until both were equal height.&nbsp;</P>
     
    <P>The hole drilling went pretty well and was completed in a couple hours
    with only a couple broken bits.&nbsp; It's a good idea to get a dozen
    1/16&quot; bits for this project.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the holes are drilled
    it's back to the drill press to remove the burr on the exit side of each
    hole.&nbsp; I used a 1/4&quot; counter sink for the deburring
    job.&nbsp; After using the counter sink a sharp wood chisel was run over
    the plate to removal any remaining small burrs.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
     
    <P>The next step was to install the upper and lower rows of decorative rivets
    on the four&nbsp; panels.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the fuel tank I slipped the rivets
    into position, soldered them and then flattened the ends.&nbsp; This time I
    tried something different&nbsp; ---- inserted the rivets, cut them off as
    short as possible and then flattened the ends with a hammer.&nbsp; I hold
    the punch with the recess for the head in a vise pointing up, position the
    rivet head in the punch and use a small hammer to pound on the end of rivet
    shank to flatten it.&nbsp; One of the problems I found was that it's
    difficult to hit only one rivet with the hammer --- the 0.2&quot; spacing is
    too close.&nbsp;&nbsp; (If an adjacent rivet is struck, it'll likely be
    knocked out.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This problem was solved by&nbsp; inserting
    every other rivet --- it was then easy hit only one rivet at a time.&nbsp;
    Once the first set of rivets were flattened, the remaining holes were filled
    and rivets flattened with out interference to or from the set already
    flattened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
     
    <P>Most the rivets on the fuel tank were a loose fit in the 1/16&quot;
    holes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the holes on the end plates that I drilled were
    such that the rivets were also a loose fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This caused a
    problem if a couple dozen rivets were inserted and then the plate turned
    upside down to cut off and flatten the rivets --- the rivets fall out.&nbsp;
    This was solved by covering the heads with masking tape and then peeling the
    tape back one rivet at a time to put the head in the punch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

          <td>Most the rivet holes on the water tank were slightly smaller and the
    rivets had to be driven into the holes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo shows a set of
            rivet being installed.&nbsp; The needle nose pliers hold the rivets
            which are tapped with hammer.&nbsp; After a few rivets are partially
            inserted, the punch (on table to right) is used to drive the rivets
            all the way in.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plate is then turned over and the
            rivet shanks cut as short as possible with diagonal cutters.
            Then&nbsp; the punch is secured in vise pointing up,&nbsp; each
            rivet head is placed on punch (head down) and the end of the rivet
            is flattened with hammer.&nbsp; After the shanks are flattened, the
            same procedure is used for the missing rivets between those already
            installed.&nbsp;</td>

    <P>OK, why didn't I buy shorter rivets so I didn't have to cut them
    off?&nbsp;&nbsp; The real reason is that I wanted to buy only one size and I
    thought I needed the 1/8&quot; to join two plates.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if
    one has to dive in the rivets as shown above, anything shorter than
    1/8&quot; is probably too short to grasp with the needle nose
    pliers.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the 1/8&quot; is really too short to join the
    two .055&quot; thick plates because it leaves only about 0.015&quot; for
    clinching.&nbsp; Hanson Rivet suggest 0.062&quot; clinching allowance for
    1/16&quot; rivets.&nbsp; The length seemed to work fine for me and since I
    ended up soldering everything, I doubt if they're be any problem.&nbsp;</P>
     
    <P>Another question --- why didn't I drill the holes slight larger so that I
    would need to drive the rivet in?&nbsp; Turns out the next size number drill
    made the holes sloppy.&nbsp; I was very happy with the results with driving
    them in, even if it did take a bit more effort.&nbsp;</P>

    <P>Some 600 rivets later the top and bottom rows (except&nbsp; at the
    corners) were all in place and flattened.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The reinforcing angles were
    then cut, clamped to the sides or ends and the sides or ends used as
    templates to drill the 14 rivet holes for each angle.&nbsp; The angles were
    then riveted in place and soldered. The photos above show the four water
    tank panels at this point.&nbsp; The markings on the inside of the panels in
    the right photo are to help me match the sides and end
    panels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

          <td>There is a small amount of
    spring back after the bending tool is released so a handle was added to the
            angel to force a
    slight additional bend.&nbsp; If the angle is too great, the top and bottom will
    push the sides out and make the tank straight.&nbsp; On the other hand, it's
    nearly impossible to pull the sides in if the bend is less than 90 degrees.
            When making the last bend the threads stripped on one of the bolts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I put a stack of washers under a new nut --- the
            washers moving the nut out to good threads. Then the bolt
            broke.&nbsp; Fortunately, the stub was long enough so that new nut and fewer
            washers could be used.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next time&nbsp; need bigger
            bolts or thinner steel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

    <P> The ends were attached to the sides with a few #0 screws and then the rivets in
    the seams joining the ends and sides were&nbsp; installed. &nbsp; A
    half dozen rivets were done at each end of each of the seams joining the ends to the
    sides.&nbsp; The area near these rivets were then spot soldered.&nbsp; This
    was
    repeated this until all four seams were done.&nbsp; This provided stability
    to the unit.&nbsp; The remaining rivets were then installed in the seams,
    the seams soldered with the iron and then heated with the torch to get good
    flow into the seam.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the bends were modified at
    a couple of the corners by pounding on a block of steel placed on the panels
    so as not to ding them.&nbsp; This corrected the angles to 90 degrees.&nbsp;
    Next one corner was pressed to bring shape from a parallelogram into a
    rectangle.&nbsp;&nbsp; The width of the tank is 12 3/16&quot;, a bit wider than planned but OK since the floor is 12 7/16&quot;,
    slightly over the 12 3/8&quot; specification. The length is 22 3/4&quot;,
    right on specification.&nbsp; Next time I'll move the bend lines out&nbsp;
    1/16&quot; on each end and cut the sides about 1/8&quot;
    shorter.&nbsp; The final step was to install the missing rivets in the top
    and bottom rows at the bends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
     
    <P> The top and bottom were next.&nbsp; There will be two tops like with the
    fuel tank: the
    lower top soldered in and the upper finished top secured with a few
    screws.&nbsp; Large holes were cut in the lower top for access to the tank.&nbsp;
    Angles were riveted and soldered to the center of the lower top for
    additional support.&nbsp; The holes were cut with a saber saw --- and a
    little rough.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
     
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img border="0" src="WT4.JPG" width="700" height="392"></P>
     
    <P>The inner top was installed first so that there was easy access to the under
    side&nbsp; for soldering.&nbsp; The iron was used first and care was taken
    to make sure solder flowed onto both the top and sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    joint was then carefully heated the joint with the propane torch so that
    the solder just started to flow. This smoothed the surface of the solder and
    also caused it to flow into the joint.&nbsp; Some solder did flow through
    and stuck to the sides just above the top. This solder was easily removed
    with a burr in the Dremel running at a relatively slow
    speed.</P>
     
    <P>The bottom was then carefully fitted with the smallest possible
    gaps.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tank was positioned bottom up, the sides clamped
    in where necessary and the bottom was then spot soldered a half dozen or so
    places to hold the bottom and sides in position.&nbsp; The tank was then
    turned over and positioned on a flat piece of particle board for
    soldering.&nbsp; The seams were fluxed and then soldered with the
    iron.&nbsp; The iron makes it possible to get some solder up on the sides
    and coat the stubs of the lower row of rivets.&nbsp; Next, the seam and just
    applied solder was fluxed again and then carefully heated with the propane
    torch.&nbsp;&nbsp; This caused the solder to flow into the seam and also
    smooth the surface of the solder.&nbsp; The second fluxing assured that the
    solder would flow into any uncoated surface.&nbsp; The next step was to test
    for leaks.&nbsp; There were two small leaks; one in a&nbsp; corner and and
    the other in the middle of one end.&nbsp; More flux, a little solder with
    the iron, more flux and a quick heat with the torch fixed
    them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

          <td><b>Upper Top - Both Tanks: </b>The next task was to make the upper or finished
            tops.&nbsp; The tops were made such that there is a gap of about 0.025&quot; on
            all sides.&nbsp; This should permit the top to be removed and
            reinstalled without scratching the paint.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photos
            show doing the fuel tank top.
            <p>After the piece
            was cut, all edges were rounded and smoothed with a file.&nbsp; Next,
            the holes were made for the rivet detail using the same drilling
            fixture as used for the lower row of rivets on the sides
            (0.2&quot; spacing).&nbsp; The holes for the corners were marked off
            by hand and center punched before drilling.&nbsp;&nbsp; The black
            marks in the photo are a reminder to not put
            rivets in those holes, screws will go in those holes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The holes were drilled and then a countersink used on the under side
            to both deburr the holes and make room for the flattened rivet end.&nbsp;&nbsp;The photo shows the setup used to start the
            rivets in the holes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            soft solder a 1/8&quot; square CRS square trim strip to the
            underside of the outer edges of the floor tender before the tank
            could be mounted.&nbsp; The floor is
            hot rolled steel that has a black coating , I think it's scale from
            the rolling process.&nbsp;&nbsp; This coating must be removed for the solder to
            stick.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ended up sanding the surface with 50 grit
            paper.&nbsp;&nbsp; The floor side of the joint was then center
            punched every inch or so. The punch mark dimples the surface
            slightly and provides clearance for the solder to flow into the
            joint.&nbsp; The mating surfaces were then cleaned with lacquer
            thinner to remove any oil or grease and the pieces clamped together as shown on
            the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Flux was then brushed on the inside of the
            joint seam. The joint was heated from the underside and solder applied to

            Four 3 ft lengths were purchased from Special Shapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The fuel tank was done first since it is smaller and hopefully easier to
            learn with.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step was to bend the half round in
            the shape of the tank.&nbsp; The areas to be bent were heated red
            hot and then quenched in cold water.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bead was then soft and easy
            to bend but hardened when worked so repeat heating was required.&nbsp;
            After the piece was in the correct shape the corners were heated and
            quenched again so it would be easy to modify the shape slighted when
            soldering on tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            conductor so it's possible to get the solder to flow the full width
            of the bead.&nbsp; After a section was soldered it was allowed to cool
            and then the tinned soldering iron was moved quickly over the edge
            and solder built up to a peak much like one would do on an auto body
            with body filler.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a section was soldered, the
            clamps were moved and the area previously under the clamps
            soldered.&nbsp;&nbsp; The perimeter of the tank was about 3 inches
            longer the a piece of bead so a small second piece was installed
            after soldering of the long piece was completed.&nbsp;</td>

    like a tank (armored vehicle).&nbsp; They are really heavy too.&nbsp; If I

            adaptors in the tank bottom.&nbsp; There are short
            pieces of tube and a compression nut on the end of the hoses.&nbsp;
            It was
            difficult to connect&nbsp; the hoses because the
            compression fittings were between frame members.&nbsp; The adaptors
            were lowered by installing a 1/8&quot; coupling between each adaptor
            and the tank bottom.&nbsp; The photo of the tank blocked up from the tender
            floor shows the lowered adaptors.&nbsp;</td>

            The valve is a 1/4&quot; pipe ball valve.&nbsp; There is a 1/4&quot;
            to 1/8&quot; reducing bushing and a 1/8&quot; nipple at the upper end
            of the valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hole in the valve is smaller than the
            ID of 1/8&quot; pipe so will probably replace this valve with one
            with a larger opening.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo shows the drain
