      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><span class="style7">As of late fall 2011 the construction 
	  of Mill Creek Central logging line was progressing such that it would 
	  likely be finished by the 2012 Logging Locomotive meet October 12-14.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time I had a Shay and 
	  Heisler but only one car --- a 3 foot log car used to carry a toolbox.&nbsp; 
	  I needed some log cars to load the Shay and Heisler so log cars 
      became the winter project.&nbsp; As the log cars progressed I realized that I 
	  needed a place to store the fleet so a Engine House/Car Bar project was 
	  born.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then several other small project have came 
	  along so 
	  I decided to add this section to the webpage to describe these smaller 
	  projects.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><table style="width: 100%">

		are fairly regularly shaped and are clean --- no dirty out-of-scale 
		bark.&nbsp;&nbsp; The thought of clean logs got me going on the project.&nbsp;
