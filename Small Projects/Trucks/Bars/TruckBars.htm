      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Early on in this project I discussed 
      bending the bars with Dan Staron.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thought was to use 
      a die of sorts.&nbsp; He said he had tried a die and was not happy with 
      the results; the 
      bars sprang back some after removal from the die.&nbsp;&nbsp; He found 
      that bending the bars around a post worked the best.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried 
	  it and it worked great!&nbsp;&nbsp;

		<p class="style8" style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial">The photo 
        above shows the tools used to bend the bars&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plate 
        with the posts (1/4&quot; dowel pins)&nbsp; is the bending fixture.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The shorter bar in the middle is a drilling template and the larger bar at 
        the top is the bender.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plates and screws on the 
        left are used to secure the bars during the bending process,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Drawings of these tools are at the end of the page.</font></p>

        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="DrillCenterHoles.jpg" width="800" height="551"></font></p>
		<p class="style8" style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial">The 
        drilling template made of 1/2&quot; square bar stock has six holes at the 
        correct position for the six rods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The holes are tight 
        clearance holes for 6-32 rods for the arch bar support rods (middle two 
        holes) and 4-40 rods for the journal box rods (outer two holes on each 
        end).&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step is to use the fixture to spot the two 
        middle holes in the bar as shown in photo above.&nbsp; After the holes 
        are spotted, the template is removed and the holes drilled through.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        .&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p class="style8">
        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="MiddleBar1.jpg" width="800" height="514"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;The next step is to mount the 
        bar on the bending fixture as show above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the 
        1/8&quot; thick middle bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle posts are separated such 
        that the 6/32 screws fit snuggly against the inside of the posts.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The screws go through holes in 1/8&quot; X 1/2&quot; stiffening plates that were 
        also spotted using the drilling template.&nbsp; </font></p>

		<p align="center">
        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="MiddleBar2.jpg" width="799" height="608"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next. the slot in the bender is 
        slipped over the bar adjacent to the post and the bar is bent just 
        beyond the hole for the outside post.&nbsp;&nbsp; This can be done very 
        precisely --- if the bend is too far, just use the bender&nbsp; to bend it back a 
        little. </font></p>
		<p align="center"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="MiddleBar3.jpg" width="800" height="608"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next, the outer post is pushed into 
        the hole, the bender moved to just outside the post and the bar is bent 
        so that the end is parallel with the middle section.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="center">
        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="MiddleBar4.jpg" width="800" height="599"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The next step is to make the two 
        bends at the other end.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="center"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="MiddleBar5.jpg" width="800" height="611"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next&nbsp; the 
        drilling template is mounted across the top of the fixture using rods through the 
        center two holes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The clamps are then added to make sure 
        everything is against the base plate.&nbsp; The holes for the journal 
        box rods are then spotted using a hand drill through the outer holes in 
        the drilling template.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the bar is removed from 
        the fixture and the four outside holes drilled through the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The last step is to make sure that the side of the bar is straight --- 
        lays flat against the base plate.&nbsp; If not, it can be bent slightly 
        by securing the bar in the vise and using channel lock pliers to grasp 
        the bar at the appropriate spot and bend as necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font></p>

        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="UpperBar1.jpg" width="800" height="330"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper bar is 
        bend using the same procedure as for the middle bar except it is secured 
        against the middle two posts of the bending fixture as shown above. </font> </p>
		<p align="center">
        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="LowerBar1.jpg" width="799" height="433"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The lower bar is bent using the same 
        process as for the other two bars except in this case only the two upper 
        posts are used to attach the bar to the fixture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo 
        above shows the situation after the&nbsp; bar has been bent and the 
        drilling fixture attached to spot the journal box rod holes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Note that the two slots in the drilling template allow the template to 
        hold the bar against the two outer posts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="center">
        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="Finished%20Bars.jpg" width="799" height="315"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The finished bars are shown above.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The middle bar is the stiffest; the other bars will tend to conform to 
        it&nbsp; when the rods are installed and tightened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Recall that the holes were made at the minimum clearance size for the 
        rods.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the holes don't line up exactly the holes can be 
        enlarged to the standard clearance size with no sacrifice in appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The ends of the bars are trimmed after the sides are assembled.</font></p>

		<p align="left">
        <font face="Arial">The length of the drilling template is not critical 9 
        1/2&quot; to 10&quot; will work fine. </font></p>
		<p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="BendingFixture.jpg" width="950" height="424"></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">As noted, the bending fixture base should be at least 2&quot; wide and 3/8&quot; thick.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used 
        a scrap piece of 3/8&quot; X 2&quot; bar about 18&quot; long.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the holes were 
        drilled slightly undersize and reamed to 1/4&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        After the pins had been inserted and removed a few times a couple fell 
        through the holes.&nbsp; Duck Tape on the under side stopped the pins 
        from falling through.</font></p>
		<p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="Bendier.jpg" width="949" height="211"></p>
		<p align="left">
        <font face="Arial">The slots were made by first drilling holes at the 
        bottom of the slots and then sawing sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; My slots don't 
        look as nice as the drawing. .&nbsp; The left slot was a little over 
        1/8&quot; but a good fit over the 1/8&quot; bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right slot is 
        used for the 3/32&quot; and 1/16&quot; bars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used a piece of 
        scrap 7/8&quot; square bar stock; 3/4&quot; square stock would have been a better 
        choice but I didn't have any.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
