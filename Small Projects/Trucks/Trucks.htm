		<p align="left" class="style9">The equipment described on these web pages is 
		intended for a 1920s era logging operation named Raccoon Valley Lumber.&nbsp; 
		Such a company would save money wherever possible by purchasing used equipment 
		and fabricating as much as possible from local materials. The trucks are 
		assumed to be made in the company shops using wood, steel bar stock and 
		castings from a local foundry. </p>
		<p align="left" class="style9">I've had problems navigating the Mill Creek Central 
		Railroad spring switches with very light cars.&nbsp; Tests several years ago&nbsp; 
		revealed that the total weight of a truck with load needs to be about 35 
		lbs to reliably operate the switches. These trucks were made as 
		heavy as possible so that they could be used as part of disconnected log 
		trucks that would reliably navigate the spring switches with no load.&nbsp; The truck pictured below ended up weighing 20 pounds.</p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The first step in the truck design process was to research  
	  prototype designs and make rough drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The drawings then 
	  evolved as each component was designed.&nbsp; The photo above and following drawings 
	  represent the last trucks built using 
	  <a href="mailto:ken.mccauley@gmail.com">Ken McCauley's</a> journal, journal lid 
	  and arch bar support castings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The journal boxes and 
	  arch bar supports can also be fabricated from bar stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font> </p>
		<p class="style8"><font face="Arial"><img height="359" src="TruckSide.jpg" width="798"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;The truck side drawing above shows the 
		signature view of the truck and the most important to get the 
		proportions correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wheels are the standard 33&quot; - 
		4 1/8&quot; with an axel spacing of 7 1/2&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The spring planks are 
		1 1/2&quot; wide ---- the lower plank 3/8&quot; thick and the upper plank 1&quot; 
		thick.&nbsp;&nbsp; The separation between the bars at the spring planks 
		is 2 1/8&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; These planks would have been hardwood on the 
		backwoods prototype being modeled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steel is used on the 
		model to increase the weight.&nbsp; The journal boxes are 1 1/4&quot; high 
		and the width of the rectangular part is also 1 1/4&quot;; the boxes are wider 
		when the tabs and posts are included.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The bars are all 1/2&quot; wide, the bottom bar is 1/16&quot; 
		thick, the middle bar 1/8&quot; thick and the upper bar 3/32&quot; thick.&nbsp; 
		Three different thicknesses were usually used on the prototype and with 
		the smallest about half the thickness of the largest.&nbsp; Bending the 
		bars was a real pain on past projects.&nbsp; This time I fabricated a fixture 
		that makes it easy to bend the bars to the exact shape required 
		(correction ---- I made 4 fixtures before I got it exactly right).&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;The rods are 4-40 at the journal boxes and 6-32 at 
		the spring planks. Four off-the -shelf coil springs are used on each 
		side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Ken McCauley designed the journals to use 3/8&quot; ID - 7/8&quot; 
		OD ball bearings.&nbsp; The journal box castings have an undersize hole 
		that is to be machined to 7/8&quot; diameter and slightly elongated at top 
		and bottom to enable the axel to move at a slight up and down angle with 
		respect to the truck side.&nbsp;&nbsp; I chose to used 5/8&quot; OD - 3/8&quot; ID 
		flanged sleeve bearings similar to what Ken Schroeder used on his 
		disconnected log trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Flats are milled in the bearing 
		side to keep them from rotating.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bearing is held in 
		position in the journal box by the three 5/16&quot; diameter screws shown in 
		the cutaway view of the left journal box.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Machining the wheels is a pain --- it gets boring after 
		a half dozen and really boring after a couple dozen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, 
		the cast iron is nice to machine but the dust makes the supervision very 
		unhappy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time I bought machined wheels from Tom 
		Bee.&nbsp;&nbsp; His wheels are bored 17 mm - 0.669&quot; and are 13/16&quot; 
		wide.&nbsp; </font> </p>

		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drawing above shows the spring 
        planks 
		and arch bar supports. The arch bar supports are attached to the lower 
		spring plank&nbsp; with a couple screws each.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower 
		spring plank has a swivel in the center to allow the two sides to rotate 
		with respect to each other.&nbsp; This concept was copied from the 
		Heisler trucks and works quite well.&nbsp; The swivel is made by welding 
		a 2&quot; length of 1/2&quot; square steel bar stock with a 3/16&quot; hole in the center to the 
		bottom center of the spring plank.&nbsp; The spring plank is then sawed 
		in half and a 10-32 screw inserted in the hole in the square bar and 
		secured with a lock nut to form the swivel.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The upper steel spring plank has a 3/4&quot; hole fitted with 
		a 3/4&quot; OD 1/2&quot; ID flanged sleeve bearing.&nbsp; The 1/2&quot; diameter car 
		attachment pin feeds through this bearing.&nbsp; A shim is fitted under 
		the bearing flange to raise the top of the flange to 3 7/8&quot; above the 
		rail head.&nbsp; This will make the coupler centerline of a typical car 
		fitted with a 1&quot; X 2&quot; center tube at the standard 4 3/8&quot; above the 
		rail head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The ends of the upper spring plank are fitted with car 
		support blocks matching the height of the center bearing. </font> </p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The lower spring plank has studs 
        (short lengths of 3/8&quot; aluminum rods held in place by 6-32 screws) 
		that fit inside of the 
		innermost pair of springs on each side to hold the springs in position.&nbsp; 
		These inter springs in turn hold the upper spring plank in position.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The upper spring plank has small notches opposite the arch bar supports 
		to permit free movement up and down as well as a slight rotation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
