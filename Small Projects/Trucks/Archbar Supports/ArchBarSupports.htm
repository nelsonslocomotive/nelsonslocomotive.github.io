        <font face="Arial">The arch bar supports are the posts on each side of the spring planks as 
        shown in the photos above.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken McCauleys castings have a brake 
        hanger mounting on the inside&nbsp; near the bottom that I cut off.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Because of the hanger mounting there are two castings, a left and a right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        T<font face="Arial">he details of one of the castings is shown in the 
        drawing above.&nbsp; As noted, the brake hanger mounting was cut off.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The first step in machining the castings was to mill the 1/2&quot; wide slot&nbsp; 
        in the bottom to a depth such that the bottom of the slot is even with 
        the bottom of the tabs on each side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step was to 
        machine the slot in the top to a depth so to the distance between the 
        bottom of the upper and lower slot is 2 1/8&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hole for 
        the 6-32 rod was drilled next.&nbsp; It is difficult to drill a straight 
        hole that deep.&nbsp; I chose to drill a 1/8&quot; hole half way from each 
        end.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is usually an offset where the two holes meet.&nbsp; 
        I then run the 0.14&quot; drill through from one end -- that smoothes most 
        the offset.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last step is to drill 1/8&quot; holes in the tabs 
        for the screws that attach the supports to the lower spring plank.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        There are dimples in the castings at the approximate location on the 
        drawing. </font></p>

            <font face="Arial"><b>New Arch Bar Support&nbsp; Casting:</b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </i>After several trucks were fabricated using castings some though 
            was given to adding brakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the biggest 
            challenges with brakes is to provide a place to secure the brake 
			hanger.&nbsp; Ken made some new castings shown 
            on the right with a tab near the top.&nbsp; The tab can be drilled 
            and tapped 6-32&nbsp; for a screw to attach to the brake hanger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            I haven't used these new&nbsp; castings on a truck yet but the plan 
            is to use them on all future trucks.</font></td>

		<p class="style9">
        The first arch bar supports fabricated were merely 1/4&quot; X 1/2&quot; bars with 
		1/4'' X 1/8&quot; half round slots.&nbsp;&nbsp; The half round slots were 
		made by gripping two 1/4&quot; X 1/2&quot; bars in the lathe 4 jaw chuck and 
		drilling a 1/4&quot; hole end to end.&nbsp; The bars were then attached to 
		the lower spring plank with a FH screw and tack welded along the inner 
		side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The supports are held in position by 1/4&quot;&nbsp; round 
		bars with a 6-32 clearance hole drilled lengthwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Three pair of trucks were made with these supports and they worked quite 
		well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If I was to fabricate 
		additional supports I'd use the design below.</p>

        <font face="Arial">The arch bar support in drawing above is similar to 
        the arch bar supports on the disconnected log trucks.&nbsp; The bar is 
        made up of the 4 steel pieces:&nbsp; a 2 1/8&quot; length of 1/4&quot; X 1/2&quot; 
        steel bar, a 2 1/8&quot; length of 3/8&quot; diameter steel bar, a 3/4&quot; length&nbsp; 
        of 1/4&quot; diameter steel rod and a 1 9/16&quot; length of 3/32&quot; X 3/8&quot; bar 
        stock.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left">
        <font face="Arial">The first step in the machining is to mount a pair of 
        the 1/4&quot;X 1/2&quot; bars in the lathe 4 jaw chuck or 1/2&quot; square collet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        A 3/8&quot; hole is then drilled lengthwise through the pair of bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Next, a 0.14&quot; hole is drilled lengthwise trhough the 3/8&quot; diameter rod 
        and the rod is then silver soldered in the slot in one of the bars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
        3/8&quot; wide X 3/32&quot; deep slot is milled in the lower part of the bar for 
        the tab bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tab bar is secured to the slot with a 4-40 
        FH screw.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1/4&quot; rod is drilled and threaded 
        6-32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A flat bottom 1/4&quot; hole&nbsp; is drilled in the 
        side of the rod-bar combination at the location for the 1/4&quot; rod.&nbsp; 
        A ~1/8&quot; deep hole is then drilled and threaded 6-32 in the center of the 
        flat bottom hole.&nbsp;&nbsp; A ~ 3/8&quot; 6-32 stud is threaded into that 
        hole.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1/4&quot; rod is threaded onto the end of the stud.&nbsp; 
        The whole assembly is heated again and silver solder added to secure the 
        tab bar and 1/4&quot; rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
