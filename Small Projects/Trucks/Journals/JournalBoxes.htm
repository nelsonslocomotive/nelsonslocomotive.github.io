		<p align="left">T<font face="Arial">he drawing above is of Ken 
        McCauley's cast aluminum journal box with lid.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lid is a separate 
        casting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The first thing I did to the casting 
        was to grind and file&nbsp;the hinge on the lid and box castings such 
        that the two pieces fit together.&nbsp;&nbsp; I drilled the hinge pin 
        holes through the lid first and then used&nbsp; those holes to spot the holes 
        for the pin in the box casting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I drilled the hinge pin 
        hole in the box from both sides, starting with a ~ .040&quot; drill and the 
        increasing the hole size to ~ .050&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used a length of ~ 
        .040&quot; diameter brass wire with the ends bent over for the hinge pin.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The 1/8&quot;&nbsp; holes for the rods 
        were drilled next.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a drilling template that fit over 
        the tabs but found that the variance in the tabs made it almost useless.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Locating the holes in the middle of the tabs front-to-back and equal 
        distance from the ends worked much better.&nbsp;&nbsp; The castings have 
        a short round stub on the inside of each tab ---- probably to match the 
        prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rod holes should be inside this stub.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        If one wants to use a rod threaded on each end then the stubs work fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        I was too lazy to thread rod ends and used treaded rod instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        I didn't like the looks of the rod threads between the tabs so I cut off 
        those stubs and cut of a length of 5/32&quot; OD - 1/8&quot; ID brass 
        tube to cover the rod threads between the tabs. </font>&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left">T<font face="Arial">he three&nbsp; 5/16-18 threaded 
        holes are for set screws to keep the sleeve bearing centered in the 
        journal; the casting comes with a ~ 0.7&quot; hole so the 5/8&quot; OD bearing 
        will have plenty of slop. (The bearing is described in the Axel &amp; Wheels 
        section)&nbsp; .&nbsp; The top set screw should be 5/16&quot; long.&nbsp; I 
        bought 3/8&quot; long cup point&nbsp; set&nbsp; screws and ground 1/16&quot; off 
        the cup end.&nbsp; The side setscrews need to be 3/8&quot; long; I used 3/8&quot; 
        long set screws here too, but ground the ends slightly to flatten the 
        ridge on the cup points.&nbsp; The top of the upper set screw should be 
        flush with the top of the casting.&nbsp; The two side setscrews should 
        be adjusted against&nbsp;the flat sides of the bearing but not tight so 
        that the axel can rotate up and down with respect to the side frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The bearing is not secured on the bottom side to enable this rotation.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The setscrews were secured with Loctite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

        <font face="Arial">&nbsp;Ken McCauley intended the journal boxes to be 
        used with 7/8&quot; OD-3/8&quot; ID- 9/32&quot; wide (R6) ball bearings.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
        used those bearings on the little log car I built&nbsp; with Ken's 
        castings and they work great.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drawing above shows 
        how the casings are machined for the ball bearings.&nbsp; Quite simply, 
        the set screws are not used and instead&nbsp; a 7/8&quot; OD end mill is used 
        to drill a hole 3/4&quot; deep.&nbsp; The end mill is then moved 0.01&quot; toward 
        the top of the box&nbsp; and.0.01&quot; toward the bottom of the box to 
        elongate the hole by 0.020&quot; to give the bearing room to move slightly 
        with respect to the journal box.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is very easy to do 
        since it is easy to grasp the box sides in the milling vise.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        There should be a lip at the bottom of the 3/4&quot; deep bearing hole that 
        will control the side-to-side movement of the axel.&nbsp;&nbsp; That lip 
        on some of the boxes I had was very small and&nbsp; I was concerned that 
        the bearing could lift over the lip.&nbsp;&nbsp; I put a 4-40 FH screw 
        up from the bottom of the casting such that the end of the screw 
        supplemented the lip in retaining the bearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

		some of the journals I fabricated from aluminum bar stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The half round slots on the sides are 1/4&quot; wide for 1/4&quot; diameter rods.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The rods are center drilled 1/8&quot; for 4-40 threaded rods.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		truck bars hold the 1/4&quot; rods in place&nbsp; and the rods in turn secure 
		the journals.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made three pair of trucks using these 
		journals and they all have performed great.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two pair are now 
		in use on disconnected log trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp; After working with the 
		cast journals I decided if I fabricate any more of the journals I'll 
		modify the design slightly to be a closer match to the cast boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		That is the design presented below.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't made any of 
		these boxes and as long as I can get the castings from Ken McCauley I 
		probably won't.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

        <font face="Arial">The box is fabricated from 1 1/4&quot; X 1 1/4&quot; 
        aluminum bar stock.&nbsp; The&nbsp; 
        machining sequence is the 3/16&quot; hole first.&nbsp; The half inch 
        wide bearing hole is next by drilling 3/8&quot; holes at the centers for 
        the two rounded ends and then using a 1/2&quot; end mill to open the hole 
        to the final shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the 1/2&quot; wide slots 
		should be 
        milled in the top and bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 3/16&quot; pin should be inserted and 
        secured with Loctite and then the 4-40 holes drilled and 
        tapped.&nbsp; The radius and slope should then machined (milled) on the front 
        surface.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Tab Bars (use same steel as the truck 
		bars)&nbsp; should be drilled as indicated 
        and then attached to the the aluminum block with 4-40 FH screws.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        appearance of the boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lid is made from a 3/16&quot; X 1&quot;&nbsp; 
        aluminum bar stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 15/16&quot; length of the end of the long 
        bar is milled to 1/8&quot; thickness and then the end is sawed off the bar 1&quot; 
        back.&nbsp; This leaves a 1/8&quot; thick lid with a 1/16&quot; lip an the top 
        representing a hinge of sorts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lip hooks over the top 
        edge of the sloped front of the box.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lid is attached to 
        the box with a 4-40 FH screw.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The screw is slightly 
        recessed and the hole filled with composite and sanded flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
