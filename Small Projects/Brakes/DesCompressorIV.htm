        <p align="left">We've covered the entire design expect for the valves 
        in Parts I, II &amp; III.&nbsp; Can't put it off any longer --- time to do 
        the valves. </p>
        <p align="left">The prototype uses piston valves with cast iron rings for both the main valve 
        and the reversing valve.&nbsp;A 
        whole bunch of rings are required and I wasn't excited about making the 
        rings.&nbsp; One alternative is to use slide valves but they have their 
        own set of problems such as not sealing very well and it's difficult to 
        get at the sealing surfaces.&nbsp; Personal experience has shown that O-Rings 
        work great on main pistons but I didn't think they would work on valve pistons 
        where the side of the rings have to slide over the ports in the side of 
        the cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a little research on this before 
        starting the compressor design and found that O-Rings seem to hold up 
        on valve pistons.&nbsp; One possible reason is that the pressure in this 
        application is much less than in many other O-Ring applications so the 
        O-Ring&nbsp; squeeze can be less.&nbsp; The test results are at <b>
        <font face="Times New Roman">
        <a href="../../ORingPistonValve/ORingPistonValve.htm">Using O-Rings on 
        Piston Valves</a></font><font face="Arial">.&nbsp; </font> </b>I also found one manufacturer that uses 
        O-Rings on the valve piston of a steam powered pump.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>O-Ring:</b>&nbsp; Initially I planned to use a #008 double seal Viton O-ring.&nbsp; 
        The&nbsp; 008 size has a nominal 5/16&quot; OD and 1/16&quot; cross section.&nbsp; 
        I build the&nbsp; valve system using this O-Ring and was not happy with 
        it.&nbsp; At the very small sizes the double seal ring seems to be less 
        robust than the regular O-Ring&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to increase 
        the size to #10 (3/8&quot;&nbsp; nominal OD) to get a little more force to 
        move the main valve and use the standard O-Ring shape.&nbsp; The #010 has a&nbsp; 0.239&quot; ID and a 
            0.070&quot; cross section width.&nbsp; The cylinder ID will be 3/8&quot; = 
            0.375&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The piston will have a 3/32&quot; wide groove 
            and I'll start with a groove ID of 0.250&quot; which will give a nominal 
            squeeze of about 0.007&quot;.&nbsp; The rings have some variation so the 
            actual squeeze will likely be in the range 0.004&quot; to 0.010&quot;.&nbsp; 
            This should give a good seal to well lubricated steam.&nbsp; The 
            seal might be too tight and make the main valve with five rings 
            difficult to move.&nbsp; If that is the case, I'll decrease the 
            groove ID slightly.</p>

            The individual components are labeled on the right side.&nbsp; The valve 
            seals are a #006 (1/8&quot; X 1/4&quot; X 1/16&quot;) Viton O-Rings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
            valve movement between the extremes is 5/32&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
            part of the ports which the O-Ring will slide over will be 0.040&quot; diameter.&nbsp; The piston diameter is 
            3/8&quot;&quot; less appropriate clearance.&nbsp; The valve rod is 1/8&quot; 
            diameter.  </td>

        <b>Main Valve Assembly: </b>The diagram above shows the main valve in 
        the two extreme positions.&nbsp; The piston has a ~3/8&quot; OD and rides in 
        a 3/8&quot; ID - 9/16&quot; OD sleeve.&nbsp; The 9 ports are labeled with the 
        destinations.&nbsp; The piston moves 0.156&quot; between the two extreme 
        positions. </p>
        <p align="left">
        One of the challenges with the valve design is to 
        figure out how to route the the steam from the ports to the destination 
        indicated on the drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Turns out that it isn't as bad as 
        it looked initially.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        <p align="left">
        The two ports that go to the bottom of the steam cylinders will go 
        straight down from the valve through the upper steam head and then 
        through the&nbsp;filler strip between the 
        cylinders to the bottom of the cylinders.&nbsp; </p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left">
        The two ports that go to the top of the steam cylinders will go from the 
        side of the valve cylinder through the upper steam head to 
        the top of the cylinders.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left">
        An exhaust channel runs from the port on the left side of the compressor 
        across the top of the head&nbsp; under the main valve to the 
        reversing valve.&nbsp; The main valve exhaust port will go 
        down to this exhaust channel.&nbsp; A small vertical passage will be 
        drilled along side the reversing valve cylinder into the exhaust channel 
        to provide exhaust to the top of the reversing valve. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left">
        The steam input goes from the port on the right side of the compressor 
        then in a channel across the top of the head to the side of the 
        valve housing and then up into the housing , around the reversing valve 
        to the side of the main valve where it feeds the two main valve steam 
        ports.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left">
        The ports on each end that go to the reversing valve will route along 
        the side of the main valve and intersect with holes that connect 
        to the 
        reversing valve housing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left">
        Another decision is the diameter of the steam passages.&nbsp; I used 
        3/32&quot; diameter passages on the single cylinder water pump&nbsp;on 
        the shay.&nbsp; It was capable of running much faster than desired when 
        the supply valve was completely opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to make 
        the majority of the passages&nbsp;here&nbsp; 0.089&quot; with any open ends plugged 
        with 4-40 set screws.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ends of the exhaust and steam 
        input passages are&nbsp; 1/8&quot; with the open ends plugged with 6-32 set 
        screws. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
