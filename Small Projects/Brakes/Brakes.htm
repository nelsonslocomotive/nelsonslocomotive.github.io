      <p align="left">The Mill Creek Central Logging Line is about 1/2 mile long 
	  and climbs about 60 feet for an average grade of about 2.3% with the grade 
	  over some short stretches exceeding 6%.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two 
	  locomotives, a Shay and a Heisler.&nbsp; Both have considerable 
	  instantaneous power but are limited by their ability to generate steam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	  The shay can climb the logging line pulling three cars and two adult 
	  passengers without having to stop to build steam.&nbsp; The Heisler (which 
	  is bigger than the Shay) can pull 5 cars and 4 adult passengers up the 
	  grade.&nbsp; So, I'm not going to worry about 20 car trains, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	  The Shay has steam powered brakes and the Heisler has air powered brakes.&nbsp; 
	  Both locomotives were able to stop the loads indicated with little or no 
	  trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after the last run I used the Heisler to 
	  drag the Shay and two cars to the loading facilities.&nbsp; That time the 
	  Heisler brakes could not stop the train ---- the train became a roller 
	  coaster. I was able to stop the locomotive with the Heisler hand operated 
	  park brake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later investigation revealed that the 
	  Heisler brakes needed adjustment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in the log car project 
	  I'd designed brakes for the trucks, primarily for appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	  After loosing the locomotive brakes I decided to install operational 
	  brakes on several of the cars as a backup for the locomotive brakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left">One of the first cars I made using the fabricated trucks 
		was a flat car with a large tool box --- I called it a utility car.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The tool box was a convenient place to carry all the stuff needed to 
		start and operate the locomotives.&nbsp;&nbsp; The utility car worked 
		great.&nbsp; However, the toolbox I selected was about 20% too big.&nbsp; 
		While discussing a possible remake of the utility car Mike Green 
		suggested I check out the logging cabooses used by Rayonier in the 
		northwest.&nbsp;&nbsp; These cabooses were essentially half cabooses on 
		flat cars.&nbsp; The half the flat car exposed was used to carry logging 
		equipment such as chains, etc.&nbsp; These cabooses were often placed 
		directly behind the locomotive.&nbsp; I decided to build such a caboose 
		to replace the utility car.&nbsp;&nbsp; The caboose could haul the 
		required tools and also a battery plus air compressor for car brakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The caboose could be arranged with one seat for a &quot;brakeman&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The brake control could be equipped with a long cord so that it could be 
		operated by the locomotive engineer if there was no brakeman.&nbsp; It 
		isn't necessary for all cars to have brakes --- I decided to put brakes 
		on the caboose and one or two skeleton log cars.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the 
		plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
