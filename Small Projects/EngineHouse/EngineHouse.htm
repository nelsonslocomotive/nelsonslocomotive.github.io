		<p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;plan was to build the structure at home then 
		disassemble it, haul it to the track and reassemble it there.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The readily available trailer could&nbsp; accommodate a structure&nbsp; 
		up to about 6' 4&quot; wide and up to about 14' long if it hung out the back 
		a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above diagram shows the&nbsp; layout that 
		meets my needs and fits within the trailer&nbsp; dimensions.&nbsp; </p>

			<span class="style5"><span class="style10">The engine house is 
		located in a very visible part of Mill Creek Central Railroad so 
		appearance was a primary concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door height at 
		30 inches is the minimum possible to accommodate the equipment while 
		keeping the building as close as possible to scale.&nbsp; The very large 
		windows would be typical of industrial buildings of the period.&nbsp; 
		Vinyl bead board soffit material that simulates vertical siding was used 
		on the sides.&nbsp; Sheet metal panels were used on the roof.&nbsp; The 
		trim is Trex composite.&nbsp; All the material is relatively maintenance 
		free &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				would be difficult to make a flat spot wide enough for a 
				turntable in the area leading up to the engine house.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				The rotary switch shown in the diagram on the right was selected
