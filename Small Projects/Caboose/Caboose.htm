      <p class="style8">Last year I made a flat car and mounted a large toolbox 
	  on it to carry all the tools, spare parts and fluids necessary to keep the 
	  steam locomotives operating.&nbsp; The concept worked great but the tool 
	  box was way oversize (out of scale) so I decided to remake the car with a 
	  smaller custom toolbox.&nbsp; I mentioned these plans to Mike Green and he 
	  suggested I consider making a logging caboose along the lines of those 
	  made by Rayonier.&nbsp; Mike later emailed some photos of several of the 
	  cabooses ---- each seemed to be different and each later one seemed to be 
	  more refined.&nbsp; The general scheme seemed to be to take a flat car and 
	  build a wooden caboose on it that took 50% to 75% of the length and leave 
	  the remaining part as a flat car to carry logging tools such as chains, 
	  log binders, etc.&nbsp; I was able to find a photo of Rayonier Caboose No 
	  3 on the internet at
	  <a href="http://wasteam.railfan.net/?level=picture&amp;id=110">
	  http://wasteam.railfan.net/?level=picture&amp;id=110</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
	  photo has a copyright so I was unable to copy it here.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I 
	  would welcome a photo a photo without copyright that I can place here)&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style11"><img height="400" src="CabooseDwg.jpg" width="1000"></p>
		<p class="style8">A requirement for the caboose is that it carry a fuel 
		container, an air compressor with small 12V battery, a small toolbox, 
		lubrication containers and several small plastic boxes with spare parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		It must also be arranged so that a brakeman can ride on the caboose. The 
		drawing above shows a design that meets these requirements.&nbsp; It is 
		very similar to Rayonier Caboose No 3 with the high section made a 
		little longer so that to could hold the fuel container.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		roofs will be hinged to permit easy access.&nbsp;&nbsp; A cushion will 
		be provided for the brakeman to sit on the lower roof in comfort.&nbsp; 
		The cushion will be stored in the caboose when not in use.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Two sets of foot pegs will be provided so that the brakeman can sit 
		facing either direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style8">Much thought was given to selecting the material for 
		the caboose sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thin strips of oak would probably 
		work great but I've seen car decks made of such strips and they 
		suffered from expansion and contraction due to changes in moisture.&nbsp; 
		High quality marine plywood could be used with saw cuts made to simulate 
		the joints of individual boards but that sounded like too much effort.&nbsp; 
		I finally settled on 1&quot; X 1/8&quot; HRS bar stock simulating 8&quot; wide boards.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		These 1&quot; wide strips will also be used for the exposed sections of 
		deck.&nbsp; The deck strips will be welded to the frame tubes from the 
		under side using a recently purchased small MIG welder.&nbsp; The 
		caboose will have a welded steel frame made of angles.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The siding boards will be welded to the frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; The roofs 
		will use steel sheets and steel frame simulating the prototype 
		composition roll roofing over a wooden sheeting and frame.&nbsp; The roof sections 
		will be flat like the first couple 
		Rayonier Cabooses rather than curved like the later versions.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style8"><strong>Flat Car: </strong> </p>
		<p class="style8">The frame was made like the skeleton log cars made 
		last year with a couple exceptions (see
		<a href="../SkeletonLogCar/SkeletonLogCar.htm">Skeleton Log Car</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		A single 1&quot; X 2&quot; X 11 gauge&nbsp; tube was used in the center rather 
		than the three 1&quot; square tubes used on the log car. (The couplers fit 
		inside the tube.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solid 3/4&quot; X 1&quot; bars were used 
		rather than the 1 1/2&quot; I beams under the mid section.&nbsp; The ends of 
		the truss rods were attached to 3/4&quot; angles welded between the frame 
		tubes just toward the middle from the center of the trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style8">The stairs were made by welding 2 3/4&quot; lengths of 3/4&quot; 
		X 1/8&quot; angle to 1&quot; X 1/8&quot; stringers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The welding was done on 
		the under side and hence not visible from the top of the car.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The end with the stairs was finished with a 2&quot; X 7&quot; piece of 1/4&quot; steel 
		notched for the center tube.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style8">The foot pegs are screwed into tabs made of 2&quot; lengths 
		of 1&quot; X 3/8&quot; bar stock welded to the inside of the side tubes and 
		centered about 1&quot; behind the end sills.&nbsp; The foot pegs are the same 
		type as used on the log cars.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ride is comfortable when 
		facing forward.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it's helpful if the brakeman has 
		long bow legs if facing backwards.&nbsp; (I may move those rear foot 
		pegs toward the center far enough so that they won't interfere with the 
		rear truck to accommodate shorter legs.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

				bar stock around the edges.&nbsp;&nbsp; The exposed part of the

		<p class="style8"><strong>Structure: </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two 
		sides and three ends were made first and then everything was welded 
		together.&nbsp;&nbsp; A frame of 3/4&quot; X 1/8&quot; angle was made for the 
		sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; The drawing above shows the framing angles in red.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The angles under the windows are 1/2&quot; X 1/8&quot; and were added as the 
		strips were welded in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that 1/4&quot; was cut 
		off the angle leg at the top of the windows so that the angle wouldn't 
		be visible through the window.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also note that the strips at 
		each end stick out 1/8&quot; beyond the fame --- the ends fit inside the 
		sides. (The frame is 36 3/4&quot; long.)</p>
		<p class="style8">The window trim pieces are 1/2&quot; X 1/8&quot; HRS strips held 
		in place by a couple small head 2-56 screws each.&nbsp; The trim 
		extends beyond the edges of the siding about 1/8&quot; to form a lip to retain 
		the acrylic window panes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style8">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img height="400" src="EndFrames.jpg" width="1000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left">The end frame members are shown in red above.&nbsp; The 
		frame members along the roof edge are 1/2&quot; X 1/8&quot; HRS and the other 
		frame members are 1/2&quot; X 1/8&quot; angle. The door trim pieces are 3/4&quot; X 
		1/8&quot; HRS strips held in place by a couple 2-56 screws each like the 
		window trim.&nbsp;&nbsp; The doors were cut from 14 gauge steel plate.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The siding boards are all 1&quot; X 1/8&quot; HRS strips except the center two 
		which are cut down to 7/8&quot; width each to accomplish the 13.75&quot; overall 
		width. </p>
		<p class="style11"><img height="719" src="BareStructure.jpg" width="999"></p>
		<p align="left">Photo above shows the bare structure after it was 
		painted. The angle above the front door is for the hinge on the front 
		roof.&nbsp; The front roof is hinged on the front and the rear roof is 
		hinged on the side.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that there&nbsp; is a small section 
		of the front roof at the rear that is attached and panted red in the 
		photo.&nbsp; The front roof must be able to clear the window frames and 
		rear roof overhang when it is opened so it can't extend all the way to 
		the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 3/4&quot; wide fixed section of roof solved that 
		problem.&nbsp; It was later painted aluminum color to match the rest of 
		the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style11"><img height="257" src="RoofTruss.jpg" width="999"></p>
		<p align="left">The drawing above shows the design of the roof trusses.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The upper pieces are 1/2&quot; X 1/8&quot; angle and the other two pieces are 1/2&quot; 
		X 1/8&quot; HRS strips.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a fixture to hold the three 
		pieces in position when they were welded together.&nbsp;&nbsp; The truss 
		shown here is 1/2&quot; wider than the one I used (1/4&quot; wider overhang on 
		each side).&nbsp; I had a problem with the fascia board hitting the side 
		of the caboose when the rear roof was lifted; the additional 1/4&quot; should 
		provide sufficient clearance. &nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style11"><img height="480" src="Roofs.jpg" width="999"></p>
		<p align="left">This is the underside for the two roofs, the rear on the 
		left and front on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; The roof sheeting is 11 gauge 
		steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is probably overkill.&nbsp; I'm not much of a 
		welder and I was concerned that I would distort thinner sheet when 
		welding it to the trusses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of trusses is 
		also probably overkill.&nbsp;&nbsp; The front roof is also a seat for 
		the brakeman so it must be sturdy.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a 1/2&quot; X 1/8&quot; 
		HRS fascia strip along the sides and a 1/2&quot; X 1/8&quot; angle fascia on the 
		two ends of the rear roof and the exposed end of the front roof.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		There is a 1/2&quot; gap between the top of the side wall and the under side 
		of the roof sheeting to provide ventilation.&nbsp;&nbsp; (It was also 
		easy to make that way.)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style11"><img height="626" src="Cab1.JPG" width="1000"></p>
		<p align="left">The finished caboose elevated on the transporter outside 
		the shop doors.&nbsp; The foot pegs fold in parallel and partially under 
		the outside frame bar. <img height="522" src="Cab2.JPG" width="1000"></p>
		<p align="left">&nbsp; A slightly different angle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		center bars in the windows are 1/8&quot; wide pin striping.&nbsp; The 3/32&quot; 
		acrylic window panes are held in position with super glue.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style11"><img height="891" src="Cab3.JPG" width="1000"></p>
		<p align="left">The 9/16&quot; rail around the deck at the front helps hold 
		tools on the deck.&nbsp; I had the 9/16&quot; bar stock and no planned use.&nbsp; 
		1/2&quot; or 5/8&quot; would work as well.&nbsp; Note the Clippard Minimatic quick 
		connect fitting for the air brakes in the sill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style11"><img height="829" src="Cab4.JPG" width="1000"></p>
		<p class="style8">This shows the roofs in the open position.</p>
		<p class="style11"><img height="750" src="Cab5.JPG" width="1000"></p>
		<p class="style8">The tall compartment holds the fuel can and the 
		propane lighter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The area below the lighters holds a coiled 
		air hose, air regulator, water hose and spare propane tank.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The brake air compressor is just to the front of the fuel container.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The lower section holds lubricating oils and other fluids, grease gun 
		and small tool box.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brakeman's cushion can&nbsp;also be 
		stored there.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style11"><img height="633" src="Cab6.JPG" width="1000"></p>
		<p align="left">This is a close-up view of the compressor system.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The tank is a spent propane cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; These&nbsp; tanks are 
		threaded 10-32 and have a Schrader valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; The valve was 
		removed and the area above the valve drilled larger to accommodate a&nbsp; 
		Clippard 1&quot; long nipple threaded male 10-32 at the bottom and female 
		10-32 at the top.&nbsp;&nbsp; A barbed hose fitting was treaded into the 
		top of the nipple.&nbsp; The compressor is from Harbor Freight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The compressor output tube was sawed in half and connected to the 1/8&quot; 
		NPT brass tee with a 1/8&quot; NPT to 5/16&quot; compression fitting.&nbsp; That 
		is a Clippard Minimatic&nbsp; quick connect silver soldered into the 
		left side of the tee; that is the air output.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 10-32 hole 
		was drilled and tapped in the hidden side of the tee to accommodate a 
		Clippard pressure switch which controls the compressor.&nbsp; The 
		battery is a 12V -7.6AH sealed lead acid (Battery Mart).&nbsp; I intend 
		to try to charge the battery with a Harbor Freight float charger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		There is a second Minimatic quick connect through the car floor in the 
		lower left hand corner of the photo.&nbsp; This second quick connect is 
		tied into the car brake air line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is to build 
		a hand held brake valve that will connect between the two quick 
		connects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style11"><img height="615" src="Train.JPG" width="1000"></p>
		<p align="left">&nbsp;Photo above shows the caboose with shay and a 
		couple log cars.&nbsp; The scene is the turntable at point Hawk at the 
		end of the Mill Creek Central Logging Line.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prototype 
		logging railroad would back the locomotive down the mountain but that's 
		too hard on the neck for us old guys so we built the turntable.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Photos suggest that these logging cabooses were often positioned 
		directly behind the locomotive possibly to keep it clear of the 
		loading-unloading operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
