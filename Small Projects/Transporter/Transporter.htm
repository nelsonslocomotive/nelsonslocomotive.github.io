		While building the Shay I modified a 
		Harbor Freight hydraulic table to make a
		<a href="../../Shay/Transporter/TransporterTest/ShayTranspoorterTest.htm">Shay Transporter</a> .&nbsp; 
		The Heisler could be moved with the Shay transporter but the tender had 
		to be removed --- a real pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; A major use of the 
		transporter is to move the equipment between the shop and the trailer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The concrete driveway next to the&nbsp; shop is smooth but sloped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		A bigger transporter was needed --- one to carry a larger load and be 
		more stable on slopes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="center">

		<p class="style15">
		The folks at Mill Creek Central put tracks on a Harbor Freight #68892 
		Motorcycle Lift shown above to use as a backup for their transfer table.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The lift costs less than $400 if purchased on sale with a discount 
		coupon.&nbsp;&nbsp; The long petal is used to raise the lift and the 
		short petal is used to lower it.&nbsp; The lift has a 1000 lb capacity 
		which was right for my use and the price was right so I purchased one 
		(on sale with discount coupon).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
