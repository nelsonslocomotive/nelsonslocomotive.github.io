		<p align="left" class="style6">The drawing above shows the assembled 
        Skeleton Log Car.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 5' long at the ends of the coupler 
        pockets and 15&quot; wide at the log bunks.&nbsp; The long pieces are 1&quot; 
        square tubes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The more typical way to make a car is to use a 
        1&quot; X 2&quot; tube down the center the ends of which are the coupler pockets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        I wanted to simulate a car made with wood beams so the 1&quot; square tubes 
        simulating 8&quot; X 8&quot; a timbers looked better to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        center three tubes can be replaced with a single 1&quot; X 2&quot; tube with no 
        loss of strength.</p>


		<p align="left" class="style6">The car was constructed in segments and 
        the description below follows that sequence: the Tubes, the Car Ends, 
        the Log Bunks, the I beams and the Truss Rods. </p>

        be attached to the channels with a few 6-32 or 8-32&nbsp; FH screws into

		<p align="left" class="style6">I used 3/16&quot; rods on the first car built.&nbsp; 
        They looked a bit over scale.&nbsp; Then I tried 1/8&quot; and they looked way 
        under scale so 5/32' rods threaded 8-32&nbsp; was the next obvious 
        choice.&nbsp; Unfortunately, inexpensive 5/32 CRS rod is not readily 
        available.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enco has 5/32&quot; drill rod for a little less than 
        $2 per 3' length so I tired that and was satisfied.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found 
        aluminum&nbsp; turnbuckles for 5/32&quot;-32 rod for a little over a dollar 
        from McMaster-Carr (3010T14).&nbsp;&nbsp; One can use all RH thread by 
        rethreading the one end of the turnbuckle.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that is done 
        the turnbuckle is installed and first and the nuts at the end of the 
        rods used to draw the rods tight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to use 8-32 
        threaded brake adjusters so I bought&nbsp; a 8-32&nbsp; LH thread tap 
        and die.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the 5/32&quot;-32 threads on the turnbuckle at 
		0.156&quot; diameter are slightly smaller than the 8-32 thread OD at ~0.160.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I couldn't find inexpensive 5/32&quot; taps and dies so I used 8-32.&nbsp; 
		The turnbuckle threads are opened slightly with the 8/32 taps.&nbsp; The 
		8/32 dies seem to give sufficient thread depth on the 5/32&quot; drill rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style6">The rods were cut to 22' length and 
        chucked in the lathe to thread the ends (die in tailstock).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Half the rods were threaded 8-32 RH on both ends and half were threaded 
        8-32 RH on one end and 8-32 LH on the other end.&nbsp; The&nbsp; rods 
        were the bend in the vise making sure the ends with the LH threads were 
        on the 7 1/4&quot; length.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two rods were then&nbsp; screwed into 
        the turnbuckle and the short ends fed through the holes in the Outside 
        Log Bunks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The turnbuckles were adjusted so that the rod 
        ends were about one third of the way in.&nbsp;&nbsp; The final 
        tightening was done via the nuts on the rod ends --- didn't want to wear 
        the threads in the aluminum turnbuckle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

		secured to the under side of the outer tubes of the center tube assembly 
		with two 10-32 SHCS each.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assembly is positioned 
		behind the&nbsp; wheels as shown&nbsp; in the photo below.&nbsp; Note 
		that the foot peg assembly is very robust to take the extreme load 
		placed on the foot pegs.&nbsp; </p>

        Tractor Supply 4&quot;-5&quot; diameter posts cut to 4' lengths were used for the 
		logs as shown above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The logs are screwed together 
		using 1&quot; X 1/8&quot; bar stock and 1/4&quot; lag screws on the under side as shown 
		in the next photo.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bars are positioned just inside of 
		the outer log bunks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The load is secured with chains 
		and turnbuckles like those described for the disconnected log trucks. </p>

		bars are 1/4&quot; X 2&quot; HRS.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tubes and Bars are welded 
		together.&nbsp; The top of the logs were chiseled a little where necessary so 
		that seat is level side-to-side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The seat is secured to the 
		logs with a couple #12 wood screws through the holes in the front ends 
		of the bars into the top logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This seat is able
