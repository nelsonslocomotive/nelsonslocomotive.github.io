            <td width="50%" valign="top"><font face="Arial"><b>Coupler Frame:&nbsp;
            </b>The basic coupler frame is made up of the two inside bars, two 
            outside bars and two end bars.&nbsp; The end bars are secured to the 
            other bars by 8-32 screws.&nbsp; </font>
            <p><font face="Arial">The two upper coupler plates are attached to the ends 
			of the inside bars with two 8-32 hex head screws per plate into 
            the same holes than have the 8-32 screws through the end bars from 
            the under side.&nbsp; The two lower coupler plates are attached to 
            the bottom ends of the inside bars with 8-32 screws running through 
            the upper plate, the inside bars and then the lower coupler 
            plate into hex nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The Diagonal Braces are used on the end 
            of the frame opposite the foot board.&nbsp;&nbsp; One end 
            attaches to the inside bar using the same hex head screw that holds 
            the upper coupler plate to the inside bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other end 
            attaches to the outside bar using a 8-32 threaded rod though the 
            spacer, then the brace and then through the outside bar.&nbsp; The 
            rod is secured with hex nuts on each end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
            spacers serve as stops to limit the rotation of the log bunk.&nbsp; 
            The location of the end holes is very critical to keep the Coupler 
            Frame square.&nbsp; I drilled the holes in one end of the brace and 
            attached it to the Inside Bar.&nbsp; I then&nbsp; squared the frame, 
            clamped&nbsp; the brace in position and use the hole in the side bar 
            to spot the other hole in the brace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
            <p>&nbsp;<p><font face="Arial">The Foot Board Brackets shown in the 
            drawing on the right are attached to the end bar using 4-40 hex head 
            screws.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Foot Board is attached to the brackets with 
            4-40 button head screws.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holes were drilled in the 
            End Bar and Foot Board first.&nbsp; The brackets were bent by 
            clamping the bar in a vise an beating the end over with a large 
            hammer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brackets were then clamped in position 
            on the End Bar and the holes spotted using the holes&nbsp; in the 
            End Bar. Those holes were then drilled out and the&nbsp; brackets 
            attached to the End Bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the Foot Board was 
            clamped to the brackets and the remaining holes in the brackets 
            spotted using the holes in the Foot Board.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
            bracket legs were marked to the correct length after the Foot Board 
            - Brackets &amp; End Bar were test assembled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

            Center Post is 4 1/2&quot; length of 3/4&quot; square HRS bar stock.&nbsp; One 
            end is drilled for 8-32 screws matching hole sin the Log Bunk 
            Channel.&nbsp; The other end is turned to 1/2 &quot; diameter and a 1/8&quot; 
            hole for a cotter pin is drilled near the end.&nbsp; The length of 
            the square part of the post should be adjusted as necessary so that 
            the bottom of the log bunk is about 3/8&quot; above the Coupler Frame 
            Side Bar.&nbsp; Alternately, shim washers can be used under the 
            shoulder of the sleeve bearing though the the Truck Upper Spring 
            Plank to adjust the Log Bunk height.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The wall thickness of the Log Bunk Filler Tubes is 
            not critical; 1/16&quot; is satisfactory. The local supplier didn't have 
            the 1/16&quot; at the time I needed them so I purchased all he had --- 
            1/8&quot; wall thickness.&nbsp; The tubes are cut to a length such that 
            they are a force fit between the End Posts and Center Post.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p><font face="Arial">The End Post and Center Post are attached to 
            the Channels first using 8-32 hex head screws and nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            The Tubes are then driven between the Channels and posts.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            If care is taken to make the tubes the same length they will force 
            the posts to be perpendicular to the Channels. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Once the tubes are in place, 0.089&quot; holes are 
            drilled in the tubes using the 3/32&quot; holes in the channels as 
            guides. #2 drive screws are then driven into the holes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            The drive screws give the appearance of rivets and secure the Tubes 
            in position between the channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
