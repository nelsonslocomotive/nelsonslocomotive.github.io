		<span class="style5">&nbsp;
		</span>
		</span>
		<span class="style14">Top coupler in photo above is new while the lower 
		one is used with accumulated dirt.&nbsp;&nbsp; The couplers are ready to 
		use except for a&nbsp; 17/65&quot; hole drilled in the shaft at the position 
		of the dimple and excess shaft sawed off.&nbsp; I disassemble 
		the couplers and paint the individual pieces before using them.</span></p>
		<p align="left" class="style13">I initially used operating couplers on each end of 
		the disconnected log trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, now that I have 
		installed relatively permanent log loads on the disconnected log trucks 
		I plan to remove the operating couplers on the ends under the logs and 
		replace them with cast dummy couplers to save $$$.</p>
		<p align="left" class="style13">The couplers are very reliable but once in a while 
		they come uncoupled --- often when a car derails.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		On one occasion I saw a caboose come loose and roll 400 yards 
		down a 2%+ grade gaining considerable speed in the process.&nbsp; 
		Fortunately someone saw what was happening and put a 2X4 across the 
		track.&nbsp; When the caboose hit the 2X4 it rolled end over end several 
		times but fortunately came to a stop before hitting anyone.</p>
		<p align="left" class="style13">On another occasion a car came loose and rolled back 
		down a grade and hit a locomotive severely damaging the frame. 
		Fortunately no one was hurt but the repairs took many months. </p>
		<p class="style12">I have become a believer in safety chains and use them 
		unless I'm running on&nbsp; a flat track.&nbsp; The very steep (5%+ 
		grades) on the Mill Creek Central Logging Line make the safety 
		chains doubly important.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style8">&nbsp;<img height="613" src="SafetyChain1.jpg" width="900" class="style13"></p>
		<p align="left"> <span class="style14">The photo&nbsp; above 
		shows the coupler and safety chain at the end of a log car.&nbsp; This car has seen quite a bit of use and is dirty.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		safety chain is 21 links per foot McMaster #3593T41, the same chain as 
		used to secure the logs.&nbsp; The threaded connectors are 5/32&quot; 
		diameter McMaster #8947T11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the chain and&nbsp; 
		threaded connectors are rated in excess of 200 lbs. </span></p>
		<p align="left" class="style14">&nbsp;The threaded connector fastens 
		through a threaded eye attached to the car sill.&nbsp; The eye is 3/16&quot; 
		diameter with a 3/8&quot; hole.&nbsp;&nbsp; The threaded part of the eye is 
		passed through a 3/8&quot; long 3/8&quot; diameter spacer.&nbsp; The base of the 
		eye is welded to the spacer to increase the strength of the eye.&nbsp; </p>

		<p align="left" class="style9"><span class="style13">&nbsp;Photo above shows the safety chain 
		eye on my Heisler locomotive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The eye is made from a piece
