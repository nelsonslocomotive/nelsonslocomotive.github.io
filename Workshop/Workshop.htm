        <p align="left" class="style3">The works &quot;workshop&quot;&nbsp; is in the basement that is nice and warm in the winter and cool in the summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		In early 2007 the wife decided that we should think about building our 
		retirement home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our previous home was a five level 
		split and we were getting too old for all those steps.&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">I dreaded the thought of the 
		building-the-house battles but the thought of a new shop was just too 
		much to pass.&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">We purchased the lot in June 2007, 
		purchased a set of plans over the internet and spent the next couple 
		months completely redesigning the plans while keeping the basic 
		footprint.&nbsp;&nbsp; We ended up with a 1 1/2 story design; everything 
		we need on the first floor, a couple guest bedrooms on the partial 
		second floor and most important, a full basement with on-grade entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">&nbsp;The&nbsp; building permit was 
		issued in early November 2007 and the builder broke ground in mid November.&nbsp; 
		The early winter was really mild so that they got it framed by the end 
		of January.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan was to have it 
		ready for occupancy in early July so we put our old house on the market 
		in mid May.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a few delays along the line.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The old house sold in August and we had to be 
		out by the end of the month.&nbsp; It was a scramble but we moved just 
		before Labor Day 2008 into a 99% complete house.&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">Early in the shop design process I set 
		down the following general objectives: &nbsp;</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">The shop is a one person operation so 
			the machinery can be close together.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">Wood working (sawing) will be done 
			outside of the shop.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">No painting other than powder coating 
			will be done in the shop.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">Silver soldering and light welding 
			will be done in the shop. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">A sit-down work area will be set up 
			by the window.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">The major fabrication area will have 
			a large workbench accessible on all sides.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">There will be a large open area for locomotive 
			assembly.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">There will be ample storage for hardware supplies 
			and material.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">The noisy air compressor will be located in 
			the garage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p align="left" class="style3">The machinery I already had and intended 
		to keep was:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">12&quot; X 36&quot; Lathe</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">Mill-Drill</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">Floor Drill Press</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">Two Grinders</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">Bead Blast Booth&nbsp; </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">4&quot; X 6&quot; Horizontal/Vertical Band Saw</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">Wire Welder</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">Belt/Disk Sander</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">Hydraulic Press </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">Construction Table Saw</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">&nbsp;Small Miter Saw&nbsp;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4">Several large tool chests and work benches. </p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p align="left" class="style3">The machinery I hoped to add was:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">&nbsp;A Vertical Band Saw</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">A 3-in-1 Sheet Metal Shear, Brake and 
			Roller.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style3">A Very Small Bench Drill Press</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p align="left" class="style3">&nbsp;The shop was pretty well finished 
		mid 2009 and has been utilized to finish the Heisler.&nbsp; I cleaned it up the other day&nbsp; (September, 
		2010) and took some photos: 
		&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style6">
		<img height="540" src="Shop0.JPG" width="720"></p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">&nbsp;This shows the back wall of the shop 
		which is under the front of the house.&nbsp; The door on the right leads 
		to the finished part of the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp; That shop sink is used 
		to clean material after soldering as well as cleaning hands, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The long narrow area in the center back of the photo is the storage area.&nbsp; 
		There are 18&quot; wide shelving units on each side.&nbsp; The water heater 
		and softener are at the back of the storage area.&nbsp; 
		The 4' wide hood is over a cart used for silver soldering and wire 
		welding.&nbsp; The stove is for curing powder coating; it hasn't been 
		used in the new shop yet.&nbsp; That is a small hydraulic press behind the 
		horizontal/vertical band saw.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The belt sender in under 
		the electrical panels.&nbsp; Part of the back wall is 
		on a 45 degree angle.&nbsp; That is the blast booth beyond the 45 degree corner 
		and then grinders barely recognizable on the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The basement is 9' from the floor to the bottom of the joists.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">The workbench in the center is 3' X 5'.&nbsp; 
		The legs are plastic --- sold under the name&nbsp; 2X4 Basics Workbench 
		Legs.&nbsp; I ordered them online from Lowes.&nbsp; The red plastic 
		containers (from Enco) store short lengths of stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
		solved the problem of organizing the scraps needed for most the locomotive 
		construction.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style6">
		<img height="526" src="Shop1.JPG" width="719"></p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">This photo was taken from the storage 
		area looking along the back wall in the opposite direction of the 
		previous photo.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bench between the grinders and the 
		Mill/Drill is 8' long and has a small bench drill press on the far end.&nbsp; 
		The shelves above the bench and grinders store small hardware items such as screws,&nbsp; 
		plumbing fittings, adhesives, etc.&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">
		<img height="540" src="Shop2.JPG" width="720" style="float: right"></p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">This photo shows the next 45 degree 
		corner.&nbsp; That is an outside wall behind the drill press and the 
		wooden locomotive/car storage stand.&nbsp; That is the Heisler tender on 
		the locomotive storage stand.&nbsp; The area along the&nbsp; pathway 
		from the drill press to the welding area behind the photographer is 
		where most the dirt is generated.&nbsp; This was a consideration in the 
		shop layout ---- keep the dirt as concentrated as possible.&nbsp; The 
		shop vac is under the 
		bench on the right ----- handy to clean up the mess.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style6">
		<img height="540" src="Shop4.JPG" width="720">&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">This photo was taken from the area of the 
		locomotive stand looking back toward the storage area.&nbsp; That is an 
		auto engine host used to lift the heavier items in the shop.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The protruding legs were shortened to make it easier to move around and the arm is 
		used in one of the shorter positions to ensure stability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		That is the 3-in-1 sheet metal tool next to the hoist.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		gray cart holds stuff used when assembling or maintaining locomotives.&nbsp; The vertical band saw is behind the cart.&nbsp; The 
		orange cart is a hydraulic table with rails on top.&nbsp; This cart is 
		used to move locomotives and cars between the work and storage stands 
		and outside for test firing and loading into the trailer for transport 
		to the track.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<img height="540" src="Shop5.JPG" width="720"></p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">This is the sit-down bench area with a 
		nice view of the lake.&nbsp; 
		The computer is used for quick references and to consult drawings; the main computer system is in the office in the other end of the 
		basement.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cabinets hold the light hand tools used for 
		the fine work.&nbsp; That is the Heisler air compressor on the bench.&nbsp; &nbsp;This 
		photo was taken from the area of the vertical band saw.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style6">&nbsp;<img height="540" src="Shop6.JPG" width="720"></p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">This photo also taken from the area of 
		the vertical band saw shows the inside wall of the shop with the woodworking tools and the outside door.&nbsp;&nbsp; The driveway to the back 
		of the house is just beyond the doors.&nbsp; Small ramps are used to roll the 
		equipment in and out of the shop.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I had hoped to have the 
		concrete drive at the same level as the door sill but concerns about 
		freezing and thawing as well as snow/ice buildup necessitated a couple 
		inch drop.)&nbsp; That is a geothermal heat pump unit to the left of the 
		workbench.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a cluttered 
		corner also used to store the kayak paddles and life vests.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<img height="540" src="Shop7.JPG" width="720"></p>
		<p align="left" class="style3">This last photo shows the relatively open 
		area used to assemble the locomotives and cars.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the 
		Heisler ready for transport to the track. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
