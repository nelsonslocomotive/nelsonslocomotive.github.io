              the upper steam head (HM562) after I was dissatisfied with one 
              made from 1/8&quot; brass bar stock like the other three heads.&nbsp; 
              The photo shows the head after it had been milled and the 
              attachment holes drilled but before the outer surface had been 
              sawed to the final contour.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't have a 3/32 drill 
              long enough to drill the full length of the exhaust passage.&nbsp; 
              The steam passage was drilled through to the exhaust passage and 
              then the excess length of steam passage just to the right of the 
              reversing valve&nbsp; was plugged and silver soldered.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              The hose connection shown in the photo supplied compressed air to 
              test the plug.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was also used later to test the 
              valves.</td>

          <p align="left"><b>Assembling &amp; Testing the Steam Valves: </b>At this 
          point the entire compressor can be assembled and tested.&nbsp; I did 
          that and it sort of ran, but not correctly.&nbsp; After taking it 
          apart dozens of times I decided it would be best to test it as it was 
          assembled.&nbsp; </p>
          <p align="left">Before assembling the valves, drill bits should be run into 
          the valve passages that connect to the main valve sleeve to clean out 
          any Loctite that may have flowed into the passages when the valve sleeve 
          was installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the set screw plugs are installed in 
          the open end of all passages using a small amount of Loctite 620 as a 
          sealer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two vertical passages from the main 
          valve to the high pressure steam cylinder should&nbsp; also be plugged with set screws but no 
          sealer --- these plugs are used only for testing the valves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          <p align="left">The valve cylinders and pistons should be lubricated 
          with oil before inserting the pistons into the cylinders. Gaskets are 
          required for the main valve end caps.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cut all the 
          gaskets from bulk&nbsp; Compressed Aramid/Buna-N Sheet Gasket 1/64&quot; 
          Thick, (McMaster-Carr #9402K21).&nbsp; The gasket and cap are not 
          required for the reversing valve at this point.&nbsp; The&nbsp; 
          reversing valve stem was attached to the reversing valve so that the 
          valve could be operated manually.</p>
          <p align="left">The first test is to position the reversing valve in 
          one of the extreme positions, apply about 30 psi to the steam input 
          and dip the head in a bucket of water to test for major leaks.&nbsp; 
          Minor leaks around the unsealed set screw plugs on the main vertical 
          passages are to be expected.&nbsp; All other major leaks must be fixed 
          so that sufficient pressure can build to operate the main valve.&nbsp; </p>
          <p align="left">Once the leaks are fixed, the reversing valve can be 
          moved between the two extreme positions and the operation of the main 
          valve detected by the thump as it slams against the end covers.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          If the thumps aren't detected, the pressure can be increased up to 
          about 100 psi if necessary to get the piston moving.&nbsp; After a few 
          dozen operations&nbsp;my valve moved at about 30 psi input pressure. </p>
          <p align="left">After the main valve is found to operate properly, the 
          head should be put in the bucket of water again and verified to have 
          no leaks (except for seepage around the unsealed set screws) in either 
          valve position.&nbsp;&nbsp; All leaks including leaks out the exhaust 
          passage should be fixed before proceeding further. </p>

          output and the gauge observed to verify that the pressure holds.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          If there is a leak, the bucket of water can be used to find it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          <p align="left"><b>Testing compressor sides:&nbsp; </b>The compressor 
          can be tested next, one side at a time.&nbsp; The output check valve 
          plug is installed in one side and the compressor run with ~100 psi 
          supplied to the steam input.&nbsp;&nbsp; The test tank should charge 
          to 30 psi fairly quickly and then the compressor will slow down.&nbsp; 
          The output check valve plug can be moved tot he other side and that 
          side tested in the same way&nbsp; (On my compressor, one side became really slow at lower pressure than 
          the other side.&nbsp; 
          If both sides run, then&nbsp; we can proceed to the next step.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          <p align="left"><b>Testing the entire compressor:&nbsp; </b>The final 
          test is to install all the check valve plugs and turn on the 
          input air.&nbsp; On my unit, the speed didn't slow down much until the 
          pressure reached about 60 psi.&nbsp; It then slowed gradually and 
          became very slow at about 90 psi.&nbsp; It continued to pulse until 
          the pressure built to about 105 psi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The graph below 
          shows the pressure build up in the 50 cubic inch test tank.</p>

          <p align="left"><b>Operational Glitch: </b>I found one operational 
          glitch ---- if there is a small leak the high pressure air piston will 
          drift to one side and bottom on every stroke at high output pressure..&nbsp; This causes uneven 
          strokes and reduces the output rates.&nbsp; I used a soap solution 
          after the tank pressure got above 90 psi and quickly found several 
          extremely small leaks around head gaskets (mostly on the steam side) 
          and around the check valve plugs.&nbsp; These leaks were fixed with a 
          little snuggling of the head bolts and check valve plugs.&nbsp;(Car 
          must be taken to avoid overt tightening the plugs to avoid squeezing 
          out the O-Ring seal.)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          <p align="left">Steam condensing in the steam cylinders appeared to a 
          major problem with the prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cocks were provided on 
          both steam cylinders to drain the condensate when the pump was started 
          cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The condensate caused no problem other than 
          very wet exhaust on the single cylinder pump&nbsp; I made for the 
          shay.&nbsp; I didn't expect to have a problem with this pump either.&nbsp; 
          As a test I submerged the pump in a bucket of water with the steam 
          input open and managed to get quite a bit of water in the steam valves 
          and small cylinder.&nbsp; The pump started with no problem and passed 
          the water through and out the exhaust.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't allow a 
          large amount of water to get into the compressor side since the 
          contents of the input (larger - low pressure) cylinder must be 
          compressed to fit into the output (smaller - high pressure) cylinder.&nbsp; 
          Since the water is essentially non compressible, the compressor will 
          stall.&nbsp; Loosening the inter cylinder or output check valve plugs 
          will allow water in the compressor to escape.&nbsp; </p>
          <p align="left">This wraps up the compressor for now.&nbsp; I'll' come 
          back and update these notes after I get the compressor running on a 
          locomotives --- probably a year from now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrangements for 
          oil feeds to both the steam and compressor sides with be made at that 
          time.</p>
