              <p>The output checks with the male thread adaptor are on the left.&nbsp; 
              As noted in Design Part V, a better design for the output checks 
              would be to leave the 1/8&quot; NPT threads on the output side and to 
              thread the output check valve housing to match.&nbsp; The input 
              side should be turned down as shown here to match with the cap&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

          <p align="left">The graph above compares the initial and the improved 
          design.&nbsp; Note that the improved design works much better.&nbsp; 
          Most the improvement is probably due to the larger passage of the input check 
          valves.&nbsp; </p>
         
          <p align="left">The operating points for the switch were initially about 45 psi 
          turn-on and 90 psi turn-off. with 95 psi input pressure.&nbsp;I then&nbsp;smoothed 
          all the surfaces and reduced the O-Ring squeeze slightly (deeper 
          groove) and the switch points changed to 55 psi turn-on and&nbsp; 80 
          psi turn-off.&nbsp; 
          I normally run at 80 psi to 120 steam on my locomotive so would expect 
          the minimum tank pressure to be about 40 psi and the maximum to be 
          about 100 psi.&nbsp; I'll probably want to design the brakes to work 
          on 40 psi and put a regulator in the line between the storage tank and 
          the brake system. </p>
         
          <p align="left">Once in a while the switch piston moves only far 
          enough to partially uncover the holes in the sleeve and the steam 
          supplied to the compressor is at a reduced rate which causes the 
          compressor to run very slow. If the compressor runs really slow it is 
          unable to overcome the loss through the hole in the piston, the 
          pressure will not build and the compressor will run continuously ---- 
          but very slowly.&nbsp; If the pressure drops below the lower trigger 
          point the switch piston moves further uncovering all the holes and 
          normal operation is restored.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
         
          <p align="left">Guess this about wraps up the compressor project. </p>
