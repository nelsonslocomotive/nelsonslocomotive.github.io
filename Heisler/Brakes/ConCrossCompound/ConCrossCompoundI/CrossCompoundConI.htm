        <p align="left">The construction doesn't follow the design sequence 
        exactly.&nbsp; Instead, I started with the larger pieces first.&nbsp; The fabrication of the cylinders 
        and the main parts of the center piece are described in this part. The construction of the&nbsp; 
        pistons, heads and center piece are described in Part II.&nbsp; The 
        compressor is finished in Part III.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            outside shape are the same for all 7 pieces.&nbsp; (Note that the 
            upper steam head HM562 was also initially fabricated at this time.&nbsp; 
            The design was later changed and a new upper steam head was made as 
            discussed in Construction Part III.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight 
            pieces of 2.5&quot; X 4.062&quot; brass were cut from 2.5&quot; X 1/8&quot; bar stock.&nbsp; 
            The eight (seven with later design) pieces were stacked and a couple 3/16&quot; holes drilled in 
            the outside waste area and then expansion pins were driven into the holes 
            to keep everything aligned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stack were then 
            clamped in the vise on the mill table and the mill indexing used to 
            center drill and then drill the&nbsp;18 head bolt holes.&nbsp; Next, &nbsp; 
            1/2&quot; holes were drilled through&nbsp; the center location of each

      The mounts were attached to the cylinder units with a recessed 2-56 screw 
      through the mount into the filler.&nbsp;&nbsp; This screw holds the mount 
      to the cylinder unit when the mount is silver soldered to the cylinder 
      unit.&nbsp;&nbsp; These screws as well as those from the cylinder ends 
      into the filler hold everything together when the unit is reheated.&nbsp; 
      One more reheating is required for the output air port (compressor cylinder 
      unit) and steam ports (steam cylinder unit).&nbsp; The photo above shows 
      the units after mounts have been soldered but before the steam and air 
      ports have been attached.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pink color of the brass &amp; 
      bronze is from the pickling solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this early design the 
      large steam and air cylinders were both 1.75&quot; ID.&nbsp; The design was 
      later changed to have a 1.5&quot; ID for the large air cylinder.&nbsp; A sleeve 
      was inserted in the large air cylinder to reduce the ID to 1.5&quot; </p>
