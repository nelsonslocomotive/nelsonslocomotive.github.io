        <p><b>Upper Air Head - Lower Steam Head: </b>The upper air head is very similar to the 
        lower  air head with the following exceptions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <p align="left">The Packing Glands are fitted to the center holes 
          instead of Rod End Caps.</li>
          <li>
          <p align="left">The Alignment Bushings also have the function of 
          retaining the rod seal in the packing gland hence are screwed rather 
          than soldered to the head.</li>
          <li>
          <p align="left">The head is an integral part of the Center Piece. </li>
        </ul>
        
          <p align="left">The upper air head and the lower steam head both have 
          the packing glands and use identical small cylinder and similar large 
          cylinder alignment bushings&nbsp; so I 
          started this section by making the glands and bushings for both heads.<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber4">
          <tr>
            <td width="50%"><b>Packing Glands:</b>&nbsp; The HM549 packing glands are 
            fake in that they are soldered to the heads and hold a O-Ring seals 
            rather than packing.&nbsp; The seals are installed from the cylinder 
            side rather than by removing the packing nut.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            <p>The first step in fabricating the glands was to mill recesses in a 
            length of 5/8&quot; diameter brass rod.&nbsp; I didn't have an easy way 
            to index the bar to get the 6 slots evenly spaced around the rod so 
            I used a hex nut threaded on the end of a rod. The indexing was done 
            by rotating the rod so that each flat was on the top and horizontal 
            as measured by a small level on the flat.&nbsp; It's not precise by 
            passed the visual test. </td>

            <td width="50%">The end of each gland is threaded 1/8&quot; with a 1/4&quot; 
            NPT die and mating hole in the head is threaded with a tap.&nbsp; A 
            better thread choice would have been 9/16&quot;&nbsp; rather than the ~ 0.535&quot;
              NPT but I didn't have a 9/16&quot; 
            tap &amp; die.&nbsp; The joint is soldered 
            so the only purpose of the threads is to hold everything together 
            if the joint is reheated.&nbsp; I didn't have an adaptor to hold the 
            hex die in the tail stock so I kept it square by pushing on it with 
            the drill chuck mounted in the tail stock as shown in the photo. 
            That worked.&nbsp; The die didn't thread all the way back so&nbsp; I 
            had to turn a recess where the shoulder on the gland rests against 
            the head so that the gland would screw in flush.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              rest 
            of the gland was machined per the drawing with no problem. </td>

        <p><b>Alignment bushings: </b>&nbsp;The alignment bushings were turned 
        per the drawings from bronze bearing rod stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial plan was to retain the 
        bushings with 2- 56 screws up though the sides of the packing glands.&nbsp; 
        On paper there is room but I was unable to drill and tap the holes without 
        piercing the side of the gland.&nbsp; Fortunately both failed attempts 
        came out the outer side so it was easy to plug the holes with screws 
        soldered in place.</p>
        <p>What did work was to make sealed end 4-40 nut inserts from 3/16&quot; rod 
        and position them on the back side of the glands where they can't be 
        seen when the pump is assembled. The clearance between the glands and 
        the small spacer ID is exactly 3/16&quot; so the inserts were positioned with 
        the side against the bottom of the gland flats which gave a little 
        clearance with the spacers. A hole was drilled in one of the bushings 
        first and it was used as a pattern to drill all the holes in the heads. 
        The holes in the heads were then used as patterns to drill the holes in 
        the remaining bushings. The holes in the head were then enlarged to 
        5/32&quot; to match the end of the inserts nuts which were then soldered in 
        place. The end of the nuts on the under side of the head were swaged 
        with a center punch to make sure they stayed in place when the head was 
        reheated. </p>

            slots in the outer edges of the bushings to match up with steam 
            channels.</p>
              <p>Air channels like those on the lower air head were added to the
              upper air head to complete it.<p>Both heads were then bolted to
              their respective cylinders and&nbsp; a ~3/4&quot; sanding drum in
              a Dremel was run around the edges to smooth the curves and to
