        <p align="left">The compressor was constructed as designed in the first 
        four design sections and ran pretty well.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Recall that along the way the upper head was redesigned and later the 
        the bore of the low pressure air cylinder was reduced.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        change on the cylinder bore was due to an engineering error -- if I would have 
        run the math on operating the compressor at ~ 100 psi steam pressure rather then 
        ~ 200 psi steam pressure I'd have recognized the problem before making 
        any chips.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Symmetry Problem: </b>All that said, I wasn't completely happy 
        with the operation.&nbsp; The main problem was that after running for a 
        while the operation became asymmetric ---- it would have a fast stroke 
        in one 
        direction and a very slow stroke in the other.&nbsp; This become so 
        pronounced that the output rate decreased and the pump didn't speed up 
        even if the air pressure on the output dropped to 20 or 30 psi.&nbsp; The 
        slowdown was caused by the high pressure side of the air compressor becoming 
        unbalanced and bottoming on one side of the stroke and be way off bottom 
        on the other side. The effect of this unbalance was that the pressure on 
        the low pressure side built well beyond the expected maximum of about 15 psi 
        relative to the atmosphere.&nbsp; (The low pressure cylinder volume is about 
        twice the high pressure cylinder volume.&nbsp; If everything is 
        perfectly balanced, at the end of the low pressure stoke the pressure in the inter 
        cylinder channel should be about 15 psi relative to the atmosphere.&nbsp; 
        If the output piston is not symmetric, then the volume in one side of 
        the high pressure cylinder available to receive the air from the low 
        pressure is less than half and the pressure will be greater than the 15 
        psi.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The unbalance can be caused by any small leak in a 
        check valve or a steam valve.&nbsp; Anyone&nbsp; familiar with DC 
        amplifiers will recognize the analogy of this problem to amplifier drift 
        which was a constant headache with vacuum tube operational amplifiers 
        (yes, I'm that old).&nbsp; The problem was confirmed by cracking the  
        inter cylinder check valve plug on the side where the pressure was 
        too high.&nbsp; The cracked plug had a small leak which bled off the 
        excess pressure and the pump centered itself, the speed increased and the output 
        rate increased. </p>
        <p>Westinghouse solved this problem by putting a pressure relief  
        on each end of the low pressure cylinder.&nbsp; I assume the relief was 
        set in the 15 to 20 psi range.&nbsp; The effect of the relief going off 
        is to allow the pressure on the two sides of the high pressure cylinder 
        to equalize and the operation to become symmetric.&nbsp; I chose to 
        ignore this relief when I designed the model (another engineering 
        mistake). It actually ran pretty well with the one plug cracked slightly 
        but that is at best a &quot;third order bug killer&quot;.&nbsp; (Note 
        that Westinghouse didn't try to balance the many sources of unbalance 
        but rather chose to fix the effect of the unbalance.)&nbsp; </p>
        <p>I didn't have room for the pressure relief on the upper air cylinder 
        head.&nbsp; I considered hanging it on the back but that wouldn't look 
        so good, even if it was on the back.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Next solution was make a small leak in the system to allow air to 
        bleed between the two sides of the low pressure cylinder.&nbsp; This was 
        accomplished by simply drilling a hole in the low pressure air piston.&nbsp; 
        I first tried a 0.040&quot; hole.&nbsp; The pump ran great!&nbsp; I could 
        easily make the pump unbalanced by introducing a large leak by 
        unscrewing one of the inter cylinder check valve plugs.&nbsp; Once the 
        system was running unbalanced I tightened the plug and found it quickly 
        returned to near symmetrical operation. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The hole of course reduces efficiency.&nbsp; Well --- make the hole 
        smaller.&nbsp; I enlarged the first hole and tapped it 4-40.&nbsp; I 
        then took a 4-40 stainless set screw and drilled a 0.0135&quot; hole (#80 
        drill) in it and installed it in the piston.&nbsp; That worked too and the loss seemed to be minor since the 
        pressure built as it did without the hole to about 100 psi but then the 
        pump continued to run slowly and the rate of pressure build was very 
        slow ----- the leak was causing a problem,&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The leak has a good characteristic ---- very little loss if the pump 
        is running fast.&nbsp; When the pump becomes unbalanced it runs much 
        slower and the leak can do the job of balancing&nbsp; the pressure and 
        in turn causing the high pressure piston&nbsp; to return to center.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The bad characteristic of the leak --- the pump never completely 
        stops.&nbsp; <b>Not elegant!&nbsp; </b></p>
        <p><b>Pressure Switch:&nbsp; </b>The prototype used a pressure switch to 
        turn the compressor on when the pressure dropped and turn it off when the 
        correct pressure was reached --- similar to the shop air compressor.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The switch shut the compressor off well below the stall pressure so the 
        compressor 
        tended to run fast even when near the maximum pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
        is exactly what I need --- a switch that would shut the compressor off 
        when the pressure reaches an acceptable level and while it is still 
        running pretty fast to minimize the loss due to the leak introduced  
        in the low pressure piston.&nbsp; The compressor ran pretty fast up to about 
        90 psi output air pressure with 100 psi steam supply pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The point of intolerable slowdown tracks the input steam pressure.</p>
        <p>So .... what I needed was a pressure switch that shut off the steam 
        input when the air pressure reached about 90% of the steam pressure.&nbsp; 
        Sounds like a job for a pressure differential switch--- just like used on 
        some old British roadsters to detect when one half the hydraulic brake 
        system failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That system used a little shuttle 
        valve with each side fed by one side of the hydraulic system&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        In our case we need a shuttle valve where one side in more sensitive 
        than the other.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>One way to make one side more sensitive is to use different piston 
        sizes and a stepped cylinder.&nbsp; That sounded like too much work.&nbsp; 
        Another option is to put an external piston rod on one side to reduce 
        the effective area of that piston.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a crude first try 
        using 5/16&quot; pistons and a 3/16&quot; rod on one side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        effective areas of the two pistons were 0.49 sq in and .077 sq in.&nbsp; 
        This system was balanced when the pressure on the large piston (the air 
        side) was 64% of the small piston (the steam side) For example, if the 
        steam side was 100 psi, then it would balance with the air pressure at 
        64 psi.&nbsp; It takes some pressure unbalance to move the shuttle --- 
        maybe 20 psi so it was anticipated the shuttle would move when the air 
        pressure was ~84 psi (turn off) and at 44 psi (turn on).&nbsp; This 
        valve actually worked quite well.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The valve worked so well that I decided to improve upon it. It would 
        be nice if the low pressure turn on was a bit higher.&nbsp; The high 
        pressure turn off could also be a bit higher --- it was running pretty 
        fast when it turned off.&nbsp; So --- less difference between the 
        effective area of the two pistons.&nbsp; It would also be nice to have 
        less difference between the high pressure turn off and the low pressure 
        turn on----- bigger pistons to reduce the unbalance required to move the 
        piston..&nbsp;&nbsp; The next attempt was 3/8&quot; pistons and a 3/16&quot; rod 
        on the one side.&nbsp; The two effective areas in this version were 0.110 
        sq in and 0.082 sq in.&nbsp; The system balance is this case is when the 
        large piston has 75% of the pressure of the small piston.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        For 100 psi steam supply, balance is at 75 psi air.&nbsp; If we assume 
        the large piston will move at 20 psi differential then the high pressure 
        turn off will be at ~ 95 psi and low pressure turn on will be at ~55 psi.&nbsp; This variation also switched&nbsp; close to these calculated 
        pressures--- about 90 psi at the top and&nbsp; about 
        55 psi.&nbsp; I used several different pressure gauges for these tests 
        --- the gauges differ more than 5% at the top end so one should read too 
        much into slight variations in the measured switch points.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <p>The sketch above shows a cross section of the switch.&nbsp; The 
        design is similar to the compressor main valve and  
        uses the same 3/8&quot; OD (#010) Viton O-Rings for piston rings.&nbsp; 
        A&nbsp; 5/16&quot; OD (#008) Viton O-Ring 
        is used for the rod seal.&nbsp; The plug in the bottom also uses the 
        #010 O-Ring 
        for the seal&nbsp; --- that was the easiest way I could figure to make a compact 
        reliable seal.&nbsp; Drawings for the individual parts are below.</p>

        <p><b>Check Valves:</b> One of the sources of the unbalance described 
        earlier was very small leaks in the check valves.&nbsp; I decided to 
        replace the Clippard based poppet check valves with the more robust 
        piston type check valves from McMaster-Carr (#7768K15).&nbsp; The piston valves are 
        described at <a href="../../CheckValves/CheckValve.htm">Check Valves </a>.&nbsp; This piston check has a larger passage area then the specific 
        poppet valve used so the pump should run a bit faster and more 
        efficiently.&nbsp; The piston type valves can be turned down to  
        essentially the same dimensions as the poppet valves for the input and 
        inter cylinder valves (see drawings for HS531 &amp; HS532 in Design part 
        II).&nbsp; The output check valves can't be machined&nbsp; to match the 
        poppet valve HS530.&nbsp; What I did was to make the recess for the 
        valve in the Output Check Valve Housing&nbsp; (HM538) deeper --- from 
        0.484&quot; to&nbsp; 0.562&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hole in the bottom of the recess 
        was expanded to 1/4' MPT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output end of the check 
        valve was turned to 9/32&quot; and an adaptor turned to fit on the end of the 
        check valve.&nbsp; The adaptor had a female end that accepted the end of 
        the check valve.&nbsp; The two parts were held together with Loctite 
        672.&nbsp; The other end of the adaptor has a 1/4&quot; MTP male thread.&nbsp; 
        (In hindsight I'd recommend that the existing 1/8&quot; NPT threads on the valve 
        output be 
        used and the housing drilled and tapped for 1/8&quot; NPT.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        input end of the output check valve was turned to match the poppet valve 
        per HS530.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
