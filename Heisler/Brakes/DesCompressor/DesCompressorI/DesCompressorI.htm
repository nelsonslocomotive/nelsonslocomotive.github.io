        <p align="left">The plan is to use a steam powered air compressor to 
        supply air to the brake system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two different types of 
        compressors were made by Westinghouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first produced 
        was a single stage pump consisting of a single steam piston driving a 
        single compressor piston.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cross compound compressor with 
        a double set of pistons was the later design.&nbsp; The cross compound 
        steam cylinders are connected such that the exhaust from the smaller 
        high pressure cylinder drives the larger low pressure cylinder.&nbsp; 
        The compressor is a two stage design where the piston of the large low 
        pressure (input) air cylinder is driven by the small high pressure steam 
        piston.&nbsp; The output of the low pressure air cylinder &nbsp; feeds into the smaller 
        second stage high pressure air cylinder which is powered by the large 
        low pressure steam piston.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the single stage and the 
        cross compound designs were 
        available is various sizes.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left">The 8 1/2&quot; cross compound is the compressor 
        on&nbsp; MRSR91.&nbsp; This page describes the operation and the pump and 
        design decisions such as exact piston sizes and the lubrication scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        A primary source of information for this page was a Westinghouse 
        Instruction Pamphlet which can be downloaded from
        <a href="http://www.grandscales.com">www.grandscales.com</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            to highlight&nbsp; the reversing valve which is driven by the high 
            pressure steam piston in the upper right cylinder. The reversing 
            valve is a piston type valve.&nbsp; The valve shown has four pair of 
            rings.&nbsp; Only two&nbsp; pair of rings are required for the reversing 
            function.&nbsp; The extra two pair of rings are used for a 
            cushioning&nbsp; function for the main valve.&nbsp; This cushioning 
            will be left out of our model.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            <p>The reversing valve is driven by the valve stem.&nbsp; The stem 
            end is 
            inside a hollow part of the high pressure steam piston rod.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            The reversing valve piston is pushed to it's upper position when the 
            high pressure steam piston&nbsp; is at it's upper most position. The

            high pressure piston is at it's lower most position.&nbsp; In other 
            words, the valve only moves when the high pressure steam piston is 
            near it's two extreme positions.&nbsp; The&nbsp; valve piston having&nbsp; 
            much less motion than the steam piston is&nbsp; referred to as to 
            having &quot;lost

            <td><b>Main Valve:</b> This side view of the compressor shows a 
            cross section of the main valve.&nbsp; The main valve has a total of 
            five pair of rings.&nbsp; (The rings are fitted in pairs with each 
            pair forming one sealing unit.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Four pairs of the rings 
            are the same size while&nbsp; the fifth pair enclose a part of the 
            valve piston (on the right end) with twice the cross sectional area 
            of each of the the four smaller pairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            <p>The left end of the valve cylinder is connected to the exhaust 
            which is at atmospheric pressure. The left side of the the larger 
            section of the right end of the piston is at the input steam 
            pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; This pressure exerts a force to the left on 
            the small part of the valve piston and twice the force to the right 
            on the larger piston.&nbsp; The pressure in the right (larger) end 
            of the valve cylinder is controlled by the reversing valve.&nbsp; 
            When the reversing valve opens the right end to the exhaust, the 
            force to the right on the large part of the piston will overcome the 
            force to the left on the small part of the piston and the valve 
            piston will move to the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the reversing valve 
            supplies the input steam pressure to the right end of the cylinder, 
            steam pressure on the two sides of the large part of the piston will 
            be balance while the pressure on the small part of the piston will 
            cause the valve piston to move to the left. </td>

        <p align="left">The prototype compressor is equipped with a switch 
        that turns the steam input on and off as necessary to maintain the 
        pressure within preset limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial plan for the model

        solution and will cause no operational problems if there are no leaks.&nbsp; 
        When the air pressure drops the compressor should start up and build the 
        pressure back to the stall pressure.&nbsp; After building a model using 
        the &quot;run till stall&quot; operation I decided to make a pressure activated
