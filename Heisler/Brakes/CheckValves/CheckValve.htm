        <p align="left">I'm into the design of the a 1.6&quot;&nbsp; scale 
        model of the 8 1/2&quot; Westinghouse Cross Compound Air Compressor&nbsp; 
        for the Heisler.&nbsp; The plan is to use the compressor for air brakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the design challenges is 
        to make very small high quality check valves; a total of 6 are required.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        A second project is the lubricator for the Heisler.&nbsp; Bad experience 
        with the check valve on the Shay lubricator has also stirred interest in 
        high quality check valves </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Piston Check Valves from McMaster-Carr:</b> The first 
        thought was to try to cut down some small check valves sold by 
        McMaster-Carr.&nbsp; These valves cost less than $10 each and are very 
        reliable.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left">After examining one of the valves it looked like machining the 
        valve to a smaller size was not practical.&nbsp; The next step was to 
        try to figure out how to disassemble the valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; Close 
        examination revealed that the piston is held in place by a small 
        retaining ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; I took out the ring and found a really 
        interesting design that I could easily reproduce.&nbsp; I also found 
        that&nbsp;I might be able to cut down the valve cylinder and use it 
        in the air compressor.&nbsp; The nice part is that after the 
        piston and O-Ring have been removed the cylinder can be silver soldered 
        to the compressor heads -- and then the piston and O-Ring installed 
        after everything cools. </p>
        <p align="left">The particular valve I disassembled is the McMaster-Carr # 
        7768K15 Brass Spring Loaded Piston Check Valve with the following 
        characteristics:&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left">The check valves are available with male or female ends 
        or a combination and in 1/4&quot;, 3/8&quot; and 1/2&quot; NPT sizes in addition to the 
        1/8&quot; size examined here.&nbsp;&nbsp; My guess is that the 180 degree 
        temperature specification is for the Buna-N O-Ring.&nbsp; The Viton O-Ring will probably 
        work at a much higher temperature, probably about 400 degrees. </p>

        the unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of flow is left to right as shown 
        by the arrows on the side of the cylinder.&nbsp; The retaining ring and piston 
        were extracted through the input side (left side in photo). </p>

        <p align="left">The sketch above shows how the piston is positioned when 
        the valve is closed and also when it is open.&nbsp; The retaining ring 
        is the stop for the piston when closed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The narrow section 
        of the cylinder keeps the spring and piston from falling (or flying) out the output side. </p>
        <p align="left">As mentioned previously, I think the standard valves 
        could be cut down for the air compressor application.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        However, there might be other cases where I want to make a similar valve 
        from scratch so thought it best to document the piston dimensions, 
        especially the groove. </p>
        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="PistonDwg.jpg" width="500" height="300"></p>
        <p align="left">The cylinder diameter around the O-Ring when the valve 
        is closed is 5/32&quot; (0.156&quot;).&nbsp; The O-Ring appears to be size 002 
        which has a 3/64&quot; nominal ID,&nbsp; 9/64&quot; nominal OD and a 0.050&quot; cross 
        section.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the piston groove OD (0.072&quot;) the cylinder ID 
        (0.0156&quot;) are greater than the nominal dimensions of the 002 O-Ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        It's difficult to measure the O-Ring OD &amp; ID but I could get a pretty 
        good measure of the cross section and the 0.050&quot; seems to be accurate 
        and the 002 is the only standard O-Ring with that cross section the next 
        size smaller is 0.040&quot; and the next size larger is 0.60&quot;.&nbsp; The 
        space between the groove and cylinder is 0.156&quot;-0.072&quot; = 0.084&quot; or 
        0.042&quot; on each side.&nbsp; That gives a 0.008&quot; squeeze on the O-Ring if 
        the stretching of the O-Ring is ignored.&nbsp; The actual squeeze is 
        probably about 0.005&quot; which seems ideal for this application.</p>
        <p align="left">The spring is&nbsp; ~ 0.33&quot; free length with&nbsp; 
        ~ 0.205 OD.&nbsp; Wire diameter is 0.008&quot; and there are 10 turns.&nbsp;&nbsp; McMaster 
        doesn't seem to carry an exact match &nbsp; They do carry 0.18&quot; OD stainless steel springs&nbsp; with 
        0.016&quot; wire size.&nbsp; Maybe one could use the 9/16&quot;&nbsp; length of 
        that spring and cut it in half.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spring would be a 
        little stiffer and the cracking pressure would be a little higher but it 
        should work.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left"><b>MCV-1 series Poppet Check Valves from Clippard: </b>I 
        used&nbsp; the Clippard MJCV-1 series poppet check valves with 1/8&quot; NPT ends on the Heisler axel 
        pump.&nbsp; They have smaller MCV-1 series poppet valves with 10-32 ends 
        that looked like they might be a better choice than a&nbsp; piston check 
        valve for the compressor and the 
        lubricator.&nbsp; They are rated for 300 psi and come with male or female ends as well as male one 
        end and female the other.&nbsp; They are available with either Buna-N or 
        Viton O-Rings and cost a little over $4 each.&nbsp; The valve with the 
        shortest length is the one with two female ends.&nbsp; I purchases some 
        of the MCV-1BB&nbsp; valves which has&nbsp; 2 female ends and a Buna-N 
        O-Ring.&nbsp; The next step was of course to take one apart. </p>

            <a href="http://www.clippard.com/">Clippard</a> website.&nbsp; Close 
            examination revealed that one end has a bushing that should come out somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
            tried slotting the bushing&nbsp; and using a flat screwdriver to unscrew 
            it.&nbsp; That didn't work. Next, I sawed off the end and discovered 
            that the bushing is secured by a sealer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bushing 
            removal scheme that worked was to use a punch to drive it into 
            the valve slightly --- to break the seal and then use a puller threaded into 
            the bushing to pull it out. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

            <td>The parts of the MCV-1 valve are shown above. The green stripe 
            around the bushing&nbsp; is the sealer--- it looks like Loctite.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            The poppet is machined from 1/4&quot; square rod.&nbsp; The poppet slides 
            in a 5/16&quot; ID cylinder. The spring appears to be identical to the 
            one used in the piston valve described at the top of the page.&nbsp; 
            The photo on right shows the poppet at a different angle.<p>For the 
            lubricator application&nbsp; I had hoped to be able to turn down the 
            end to 5/16&quot; and thread it 5/16-24 to accept a compression nut for 
            1/8&quot; tube.&nbsp; That can be done on the input end.&nbsp; However, 
            the bushing&nbsp; in the output end is 5/16&quot; OD so that end can't be reduced 
            to 5/16&quot; OD.&nbsp; However, the entire end can be turned to 3/8&quot; and 
            threaded 3/8-24 for a compression nut for 3/16&quot; tube.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
            short 1/8&quot; to 3/16&quot; bushing can be soldered on the end of the 1/8&quot; 
            tube to work with the 3/16&quot; compression nut.</p>

        <p>After tearing apart the MCV-1 valve I assumed the MCV-2 valve was 
        also held together with sealer.&nbsp; I griped the round end very firmly 
        in the lathe 3-jaw check and used a wrench to turn the hex end.&nbsp; 
        Once the seal broke it was fairly easy to pull the two pieces apart.&nbsp; 
        Photo above shows the three pieces of the MCV-2 valve.&nbsp; The 
        duckbill seal fits into the one end as shown in the photo below.&nbsp; </p>

        I may use the MCV-2 in the lubricating oil lines on the lubricator since the output (round) 
        end can easily be threaded 5/15-24 for a 1/8&quot; tube compression fitting.&nbsp; 
        However, I don't think I'll use it for steam oil lines that feed into 
        high pressure steam lines; I don't want to risk the mess should the 
        check valve leak and allow steam back into the lubricator. </p>

        After seeing all these parts I may never make another check valve.</p>
