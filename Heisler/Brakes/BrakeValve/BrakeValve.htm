        <p class="style12">The Shay brake valve was redone several times to get 
		a satisfactory design.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the complications was that the 
		particular Shay modeled used steam to apply the brakes and also steam to 
		release the brakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Heisler doesn't have that 
		complication since the brake cylinders have spring returns.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Recently Dick McCloy showed me a Clippard regulator that had been 
		modified to make it into a brake valve.&nbsp; The modifications are to 
		replace the fine thread adjustment screw with a very course acme thread 
		screw and add a handle to the screw.&nbsp; The course thread 
		makes the output go from zero pressure to full pressure in one turn or so.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style12">The neat thing about the regulator type valve is that 
		the pressure on the brakes is relatively constant independent of the 
		supply pressure.&nbsp; Another neat feature is partial braking on 
		long downgrades.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style12">I've used the Clippard regulators for the oil 
		atomizer and am using one for the blower 
		on the Heisler.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently Enco had their 3/8-12 acme tap 
		on sale and with a discount for about $40 so I bought one with 
		construstion of a brake valve in mind.</p>
		<p class="style12"><img height="152" src="Tap.jpg" width="698"> </p>
		<p class="style12">&nbsp;The tap&nbsp; is pictured above.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that 
		it it cuts the treads in two steps, the first step cuts a V and the 
		second step squares up the V.&nbsp; Dick McCloy had some 3/8-12 threaded 
		rod so I got a piece&nbsp; and went about building a brake valve. </p>
		<p class="style3">
		<img height="177" src="Reguator.jpg" width="700" class="style13"></p>
		<p class="style12">The photo above shows a disassembled regulator.&nbsp; 
		The inside of the next to the last piece on the right (the cap) needs to 
		be rethreaded with the acme threads.&nbsp; The last piece on the right 
		(the adjustment screw)&nbsp; needs to be replaced with the acme threaded 
		rod.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The cap is sealed to the body with the blue sealer 
		visible on the cap.&nbsp; I clamped the body in the the lathe 3-jaw 
		chuck and removed the cap using channel lock pliers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		nuts that screw on the top of the cap were screwed on tight and used to 
		hold the cap in the 3-jaw chuck.&nbsp; The tap was put in the tail stock 
		chuck and the cap turned by hand to tap the threads.&nbsp; </p>

		<p class="style12">I haven't used the valve at the track yet but have 
		used it on the test stand and it performs great --- exactly as expected 
		with one exception.&nbsp; The valve Dick McCloy showed me seemed to 
		respond with less turning --- the screw tread is probably 8 TPI or 10&nbsp; 
		TPI.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also recalled that he said he got the valve from Tom 
		Bee.</p>
		<p class="style12">So, went to Tom Bee's website (<a href="http://iprr.topcities.com/tombee">Tom 
		Bee 1.5&quot; Scale Products</a>) and discovered he has a whole line of 
		useful brake parts including the brake valves for $35 with a really nice 
		handle.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could buy all the valves I need for a lifetime for 
		much less than the cost of a coarser thread acme tap so next time I will 
		buy my valve from Tom Bee.&nbsp; </p>
