        <p class="style12">This page describes the interconnection of the Steam 
		Air Compressor, Electric Air Compressor, Air tank, Brake Valve, Brake 
		Cylinders and Brake Gauges.&nbsp; The water plumbing and nearly all of 
		the fuel plumbing is on the left side of the locomotive.&nbsp; The Brake 
		plumbing is nearly exclusively on the right side of the locomotive.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style12">
		<img height="512" src="BrakePlumbing.jpg" width="800"></p>
		<p class="style12">The diagram above shows the interconnection of the 
		air brake components.&nbsp;&nbsp; The air generation is at the top with 
		the steam powered compressor on the right and the electric compressor on 
		the left.&nbsp; The steam compressor is the main unit with the electric 
		compressor a backup.&nbsp; There are piston type check valves between 
		each compressor and the main air supply line to prevent a leak through a 
		faulty valve in either compressor.</p>
		<p class="style12">The Brake Valve is the connection between the 
		air supply line at the top and the brake line at the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Note that there are gauges on both the air supply and the brake line 
		sides of the system.&nbsp; Also note that there are drain valves on the 
		air tank and both brake cylinders to drain off condensate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style12">The hard plumbing is with 1/4&quot; copper tube and scale 
		fittings on the air supply side and 3/16&quot; hard copper tube with scale 
		fittings on the brake line side.&nbsp; Clippard 1/8&quot; ID hose is 
		used to the brake cylinders, brake valve, pressure switch and brake line 
		gauge.&nbsp; Clippard fittings are used to interconnect the hose to the 
		hard copper tube.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style12">The following provides more detail on the specific 
		fittings used.&nbsp; Consult the Clippard online catalogue for more 
		information on the hundreds of available fittings. </p>
