        Dick McCloy at Mill Creek Central Railroad has been experimenting small 
		12 volt air compressors for brakes on his long (40+) car trains.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The compressor he favors is Harbor Freight Item #96068 which lists for 
		$30.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several have seen quite a bit of use but none have been 
		used long enough to verify the long term reliability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		When laying out the the Heisler electrical compartment it was discovered that 
		there was room for one of these compressors but it would be better if 
		some of the parts not required for this application were removed.&nbsp; 
		I started it disassemble the compressor part and ended up taking the 
		compressor nearly completely apart.&nbsp;&nbsp; The design is very 
		simple and should be fairly reliable so I decided to include the data 
		here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <img height="361" src="EAC1.JPG" width="700" class="style2"></p>
		<p class="style8">
        Photo above shows the complete compressor unit.&nbsp; The power cord has 
		a fused plug that is inserted into a cigarette lighter socket.&nbsp; The 
		end of the yellow hose has a fitting that screws onto a tire valve stem.</p>
		<p class="style1">
        <img height="516" src="EAC2.JPG" width="700" class="style2"></p>
		<p class="style8">
        The first step in disassembly was to unscrew the quick connect fitting.&nbsp; 
		The treads appear to be straight (not tapered) and metric.&nbsp; A 
		sealer was used on the threads. The handle slides off&nbsp; once the 
		quick connect is removed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The gauge comes off easily; the 
		gauge threads appears to 1/16&quot; NPT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        The four head screws come out rather easily ---- the head seals are

        The compressors seem to be well constructed and should provided many 
		hours of operation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't take the motor apart.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The motor brushes will wear.&nbsp; I didn't check the parts list to see 
		if replacement brushes are available.&nbsp; The motor will have two shaft 
		bearings which I also didn't check; if they are sleeve bearings it would 
		probably be appropriate to oil them periodically.&nbsp; The inside of 
		the cylinder sleeve had a light grease lubricant.&nbsp; It would 
		probably be wise to add some grease periodically - maybe once a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
