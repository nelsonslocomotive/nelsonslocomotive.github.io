        <p align="left">I'm designing a 1.6&quot;&nbsp; scale 
        model of the 8 1/2&quot; Westinghouse Cross Compound Air Compressor.&nbsp; 
        The plan is to use O-Rings on the pistons, in the check valves and as 
        seals around the piston rods.&nbsp; The compressor uses two piston 
        valves.&nbsp; The reversing valve which is driven by the high pressure 
        piston has two rings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main valve which is operating by 
        steam controlled by the reversing valve has 5 rings.&nbsp; The rings on 
        the pistons valves must slide over the ports (holes)&nbsp; in the side 
        of the valve cylinder.&nbsp; Cast iron rings are normally used on piston 
        valves.&nbsp; O-Ring failures are often traced to rough mating surfaces 
        so the natural conclusion is that O rings would fail quickly if used on 
        a piston valve.&nbsp; However, if the holes were kept small relative to 
        the O-Ring cross section, maybe they would work.&nbsp; For this high 
        temperature application Viton O-Rings would normally be used.&nbsp; 
        Viton is tougher than the Buna-N O-Ring one normally uses so the added 
        toughness might help. </p>
        <p align="left">I've never seen where anyone has use O-Rings on piston 
        valves and I suspect the manufacturer would discourage their use in this 
        type application.&nbsp; So, to settle my curiosity I decided to test 
        some O-Rings in a situation where the cylinder has holes on the side and 
        the O-Ring must pass over the holes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The timing of 
        this test was related to the failure of the speed reducer on my old band 
        saw.&nbsp; The saw was designed for cutting wood&nbsp; but an optional belt and chain 
        driven speed 
        reducer was added to slow the blade speed&nbsp; so that it could be used to saw metal.&nbsp; 
        The speed reducer was worn out --- the teeth on the final drive sprocket 
        were nearly worn off and the sleeve bearings were oval rather than 
        round.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan was to remove the speed reducer and make the 
        saw run at high speed only --- great for wood.&nbsp; I would then give 
        the saw to the brother-in-law and buy a new metal cutting band 
        saw.&nbsp; I was able to repair the sprocket enough so that it would 
        drive a light load.&nbsp; So, the O-Ring test had to be run before I 
        gave away the motor with the saw.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <img border="0" src="TestSetup.jpg" width="586" height="262"></p>
        <p align="left">The photo above shows the test setup.&nbsp; The output 
        pulley was replaced by a piece of aluminum&nbsp; with a off center 
        6-32 hole that would hold the screw used as a crank pin.&nbsp; The rod 
        and piston in this case are 1/2&quot; OD cold formed steel.&nbsp; The 
        cylinder is&nbsp; 5/8&quot; OD brass which is clamped in a block of aluminum. 
        The upper end of the aluminum block is held to the speed reducer by a 
        bolt.&nbsp; The block is free to rotate on the bolt as necessary to keep 
        the cylinder,&nbsp; piston and rod in alignment with the crank pin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The stroke is about 3/4&quot; and the drive provides ~80 strokes per minute.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Piston.jpg" width="600" height="224"></p>
        <p align="left">This photo shows a close up of the piston, O-Ring and 
        cylinder. These O-Rings are 1/2&quot; OD, 5/16&quot; ID and made of Viton.&nbsp; 
        The holes in the cylinder simulating ports are 1/16&quot; diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        When the test is running both&nbsp; O-Rings are inside the cylinder for 
        the entire stroke </p>
        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="ORing.jpg" width="524" height="411"></p>
        <p align="left">The test apparatus was run for about 45minutes and then 
        the O-Rings examined --- see photo above.&nbsp; Two different groove 
        depths were used.&nbsp; The left O-Ring had a squeeze of about 0.008&quot;&nbsp; 
        and the one on the right has a squeeze of 0.005&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The 
        standard squeeze is about 0.13&quot; but that will seal many hundreds or 
        possibly thousands of pounds.&nbsp; For my application at 100 psi, 
        0.005&quot; squeeze is more than adequate.)&nbsp; The white speck on the 
        right O-Ring is a bit of debris related to a filthy workshop and not the 
        test.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The O-Ring on the left shows a bit of wear in 
        that the parting ridge is pretty well worn off.&nbsp; Neither ring shows 
        any apparent damage.&nbsp;&nbsp; The piston is cold formed 1/2&quot; rod that 
        was not machined except for the grooves.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rod was 
        polished with fine sandpaper.&nbsp; The pits are apparently from the 
        rolling or forming process. </p>
        <p align="left">I'd figured there was a good probability that the 1/2&quot; 
        O-Rings would be severely damaged and&nbsp; I'd terminate the test at 
        this point.&nbsp; That didn't happen.&nbsp; So, the next step was to 
        test some 5/16&quot; OD - 3/16&quot;&nbsp; O-Rings which are a better match for 
        the compressor application.&nbsp; The only O-Rings I had in this size 
        are EPDM which are not as tough as the Viton rings I'd probably use. </p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">Photo above shows the new test cylinder for the 5/16&quot; OD 
        O=Ring test.&nbsp; The grooves cut in the outside of the cylinder&nbsp;helped&nbsp;with alignment of the ports (holes) around the cylinder. 
        This time many more holes were drilled.&nbsp; The hole size was 0.055&quot;, 
        a bit larger than I'd probably use in a working design. </p>
        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="312ORing2.jpg" width="500" height="260"></p>
        <p align="left">The photo above shows the piston and O-Rings after about 
        5,000 strokes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The left O-Ring has a squeeze of 0.010&quot; and 
        the other five have a squeeze of 0.005&quot;&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="312ORing3.jpg" width="499" height="385">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>This photo shows a close-up of the left three O-Rings after the 5,000 
        strokes.&nbsp; Again, no obvious damage. </p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">
        <img border="0" src="PressureTest.jpg" width="500" height="255"></p>
        <p align="left">The next step was to check the O-Rings to see if they 
        seal.&nbsp; A ring was soldered around&nbsp; one of the sets of ports in 
        the cylinder as shown in the photo above.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ring was 
        supplied with 100 
        psi air and the cylinder was submerged in a bowl of 
        water to check for leaks.&nbsp; No leaks when the piston was aligned 
        such there was an O-Ring on each side of the pressurized ports.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="left">The next thought was whether pressure would increase the 
        wear on the O-Rings so the test was run another hour (~ 5.000 strokes) 
        with the one set of ports at 100 psi.&nbsp;&nbsp; The O-Rings were 
        then examined again and there was still no observable wear.&nbsp; </p>

          <tr>
            <td>The last question I could think of was how much force is 
            required to slide the piston with the six O-Rings.&nbsp; I used 
            the setup shown on the right.&nbsp; The Tropicana jug was filled 
            with water until it weighed enough to pull the piston.&nbsp; It took 
            about 1.25 quarts which I rounded to 48oz and another 4 oz was added 
            for the piston for a total of 52 oz of 3.25 lbs force.&nbsp;

              <font face="Arial">It takes 43 psi to exert 3.25 lbs force on a 
              5/16&quot; diameter piston.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pump will be operated with&nbsp;80 to 100 
              psi steam pressure and the valve will use 5 O-Rings instead&nbsp;of the 
              6 O-Rings in the test so should have plenty of margin.&nbsp;</font></div>

        <p align="left">This test was encouraging enough to build the compressor 
        valve using O-Rings.&nbsp; If it turns out that the O-Ring failures are 
        unacceptably high, I can convert it to metal rings by making new valve 
        pistons and of course, making the rings. </p>
        <p align="left">After running this test Ii was able to examine the parts 
        list of a commercially available steam powered pump and found that 
        O-Rings were used for the main valve in that design which has a number 
        of years of successful operation .&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
