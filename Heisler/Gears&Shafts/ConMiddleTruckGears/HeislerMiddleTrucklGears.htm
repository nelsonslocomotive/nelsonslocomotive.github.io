      <p align="left">The middle truck uses the same gear case and end cap as 
      the outside truck.&nbsp; The big difference with the middle truck is the 
      addition of the spur gears, the gear box for the spurs gears, a longer 
      pinion tube and the addition of a line shaft.&nbsp;&nbsp; This page 
      focuses on these added parts used only on the middle truck.&nbsp; Refer to 
      the <a href="../DesMiddleTruckGears/HeislerMiddleTruckGears.htm">Middle Truck Gear Design</a> page for design information.

        <p align="left"><b>Oval Gear Box: </b>&nbsp; The next step was to go 
        back to the design stage and dig out an earlier gearbox version using tubes 
        (see <a href="../DesOutsideTruckGears/HeislerOutsideTrucklGears.htm">Outside Truck Gear Design</a> for drawings) in an oval configuration.&nbsp; The oval gear box is 
        fabricated from two short lengths a 2.25&quot; OD - 1.5&quot; ID steel tube.&nbsp; 
        This is the same type tube used in the gearbox end cap.

            1.5&quot; diameter which matches&nbsp; the ID of these tubes.&nbsp; The 
            pinion tube slides in 0.406&quot;.&nbsp; The remaining length of that 
            tube was bored to 1.75&quot; to provide clearance for the spur gear.&nbsp; 
            The other tube was bored 1.75' the entire length and then a 0.406&quot; 
            long&nbsp; 1.75&quot; OD - 1.25&quot; ID sleeve&nbsp; (the same stock as used 
            for the pinion tubes) was silver soldered into one end.&nbsp; A 
            1.375&quot; diameter 0.312&quot; deep recess was then bored in the sleeve for

            time.)&nbsp; It is not necessary that the cut depth be the same on 
            both tubes.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp; the depth of cut on the tube that 
            connects with the pinion tube was only about 0.350&quot; to avoid cutting 
            though the side of 1.5&quot; diameter end that mates with the pinion 
            tube.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo shows some of the first milling cuts on

            on the tube for the line shaft.&nbsp; I left a little excess 
            material so that the centers were about 1.51&quot; instead of 1.50&quot; to

            are retained in their recesses by the spur gear on one end and the pinion gear 
            on the other.&nbsp; The other spur gear was mounted to the line

            is held in position by the spur gear which is captured between
