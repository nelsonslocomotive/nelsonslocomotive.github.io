      <p align="left">The sketch below shows the gear arrangement for the
      two-truck Heisler.&nbsp; (The sketch is taken from a marketing brochure
      originally published in the 1920s.&nbsp; The comments below the sketch
      were probably penned by a marketer or salesman.)&nbsp; The drive shafts pass over the inner axels to
      universals.&nbsp; After the universals the truck shafts slope downward to the
      pinion gears.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The front and rear truck of the
      three-truck Heisler use the same configuration shown here.&nbsp; The middle
      truck however must be different; there must be a way to get the driveshaft
      through the middle truck to the rear truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; The investigation
      of the middle truck was a good excuse for a trip to Cass in June, 2004.</p>

          the rear.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brass/bronze lower bearing halves show the
          locations of the two shafts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <p>The photo shows 3 bearings for&nbsp; the right shaft and 2 bearings
          for the left shaft. The left shaft has a third bearing&nbsp; over

          removed.&nbsp;</td>

        <p align="left">Note that there is a universal on each end of the
        shaft.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a bearing on each side of the gear and a
        third bearing just in front of the rear universal.&nbsp;&nbsp; I assume
        that the bearing caps were removed and the shaft then lifted up and
        out.&nbsp; (This was after cross pieces at the top of the truck were
        removed.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><b>Pinion Shaft:&nbsp; </b>The photo below shows the
      pinion
      shaft.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shaft broke between the pinion gear and the spur
      gear when the locomotive was going up the mountain.&nbsp; There
      was still power to the front and rear trucks so it was possible to drive
      the locomotive back to the shop.&nbsp;&nbsp; The broken ends wore against
      each other to make it appear the shaft was cut rather than
      broken.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left"><b>Jack Stands:&nbsp; </b>How does one remove a locomotive
      truck?&nbsp;&nbsp; Easy, jacks and jack stands.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next photo
      is taken from the rear of the locomotive looking toward the front.&nbsp;
      The blocks are under the middle truck bolster.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      This photo gives a good view of where the drive shaft passes under
      the firebox between the two ash pits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The small tubes on the
      left come from the lubricator that provide forced lubrication to some of
      the bearings in the truck.&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left">The next photo of the rear side of the middle truck
      was taken a few months before the shaft broke.&nbsp; The drive shaft
      on the right side goes to the rear truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case enclosing
      the bevel gear is near the left wheel.&nbsp; That's a water hose from the tender in the center of
      the photo.&nbsp; The chains that connect near the wheels limit the amount
      the truck can rotate --- I assume if the engine derails.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
      think the chain closest to the camera loops under the drive shaft and keeps
      it from dropping to the ground should something come loose or break.&nbsp; </p>
