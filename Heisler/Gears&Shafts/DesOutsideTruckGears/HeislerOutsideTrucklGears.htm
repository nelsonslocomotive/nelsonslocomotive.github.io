      <p align="left">The design of the gear system for the Heisler model has 
      involved more iterations than any other piece tackled to this point.&nbsp; 
      Some of the variables include gear and bearing selection and whether to 
      cast or fabricate the gear case.&nbsp; The decision on the case was to 
      fabricate it from stock tubes. The same case is used for all 
      trucks.&nbsp; The middle truck has an add-on for the spur gears.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Sealed ball bearings are used for both the gear cases and for the axels.&nbsp; 
      The bevel gears are standard Boston Gear and Martin Gear products and are 
      the same as used in Ken Schroeder's shay.&nbsp;&nbsp; This page describes 
      the design of the gear case and the application to the outside trucks (at 
      front of locomotive and under the tender).
      

      <p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img border="0" src="GearAssemblySection.jpg" width="700" height="450"></p>


      <p align="left">The drawing above shows a cross section of the gear 
      assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following describes the individual components.&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Gear Case:</b> The Gear Case&nbsp;(red in drawing)&nbsp; is made of two 
      pieces of round tubing intersecting at right angles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The large tube 
      that runs vertically in the drawing is is 3.5&quot; OD and 3&quot; ID.&nbsp; The 
      lower end of this tube is plugged with a 0.5&quot; thick plate that is bored 
      for the lower bearing.&nbsp; The smaller tube runs horizontally in the 
      drawing is 2&quot; OD and 1.75&quot; ID.&nbsp; This smaller tube is plugged on the 
      right side with a 0.25&quot; plate.&nbsp; Note that about one third the width 
      of the smaller tube extends beyond (below on the drawing) the larger tube.&nbsp; 
      The fabrication plan is described below and (hopefully) is not as difficult as it 
      might seem. </p>


      <p align="left"><b>End Cap: </b>The end cap which attaches to the open end 
      of the case is made from 1/4&quot; thick plate and 2.25&quot; OD - 1.75&quot; ID tube 
      that is silver soldered into the plate.&nbsp; The plate is turned so that 
      it fits into the open (upper) end of large gear case tube.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      tube is bored to 1.875&quot; to accept the bearing with a shoulder left on the 
      end to retain the bearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The end cap is attached to the case 
      by screws through the the cap into the edge of the large gear case tube.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Pinion Tube: </b>The pinion tube is a length of 1.75&quot; 
      OD 1.25&quot; ID tube.&nbsp; The length depends on the truck with the tube for 
      the middle truck longer than for the front and rear trucks.&nbsp; The 
      pinion shaft bearing are standard R10 double sealed ball bearing bearings.&nbsp; 
      The bearings and shaft are held in place by the pinion gear on one end and 
      either a universal (front and rear trucks) or a spur gear (middle truck) 
      on the other end.&nbsp; The pinion unit consisting of the tube, pinion 
      shaft and bearings is assembled first and then slid into the gear case.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The pinion tube is held in position by the swivel shaft mounting screws. </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Main Gear: </b>The main gear is a 12 DP-20 degree 
      pressure angle unhardened 36 tooth steel bevel gear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Boston 
      Gear and Martin Gear have suitable gears. Boston L152Y-G and Martin 
      BS1236-2&nbsp; have the 1&quot; bore required for this application.&nbsp; The 
      Boston L152BY-G and Martin BS1236-2A have a 5/8&quot; ID which can be used if&nbsp; 
      bored to 1&quot;.&nbsp; The hub for all these gears is 2.125&quot; diameter and 
      projects 7/8&quot;.&nbsp; The hub diameter will be turned down to&nbsp;a little 
      less than 1.875&quot; so that it will fit in the cap.&nbsp; The hub projection 
      will be reduced to 9/16&quot;.&nbsp; The gear will be broached for a 3/16&quot; key and 
      the hub drilled &amp; tapped for a set screw. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Pinion Gear: </b>The pinion gear is a 12 DP-20 degree 
      pressure angle unhardened 18 tooth steel bevel gear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Boston 
      Gear and Martin Gear have suitable gears. Boston L152BY-P and BS1218-2A 
      have a 1/2&quot; ID which must be bored to 5/8&quot; for this application.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The hub for these gears&nbsp; is 1.3125 diameter and projects 13/16&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The hub diameter is OK but the projection will be reduced to 9/16&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The gear will be broached for a 3/16&quot; key and the hub drilled &amp; tapped for a set 
      screw.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Axel Bearings: </b>&nbsp;The axel bearings in the gear 
      case are R14-2RS double sealed ball bearings.&nbsp; This bearing has a 
      7/8&quot; ID, 1 7/8&quot; OD and is 1/2&quot; wide.&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Pinion Bearings: </b>The pinion shaft bearings are
      R10-2RS double sealed ball bearings. This bearing has a&nbsp; 5/8&quot; ID and 1 
      3/8&quot; OD and 11/32&quot; thick.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Axel: </b>The axel which runs through the gear case is 
      turned from 1&quot; diameter steel rod.&nbsp; The part inside the gear case is 
      left at 1&quot; diameter and slotted for a 3/16&quot; key.&nbsp; The axel is turned down 
      to 7/8&quot; for the gear case bearings and turned down further to 3/4&quot; for the 
      truck axel bearings. The axel is shown on the truck drawings</p>


      <p align="left"><b>Pinion Shaft: </b>The pinion shaft is a length of 5/8&quot; 
      diameter mild steel rod.&nbsp; The only machining required is cutting key 
      slots in each end and a groove for an E-type retaining ring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

      <p align="left">The sketch above shows a side view of the gear case, 
      pinion tube and a universal applied to an outside tuck.&nbsp; The truck
      bolster and lower cross piece are sectioned in the middle. The gear 
      case is angled up at 10 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The angle is set so 
      that the drive shaft center is positioned 1.25&quot; above the axel center.&nbsp; 
      The swivel shaft is screwed to the gear case on one side and on the other 
      side fits into a sleeve bearing attached to the truck lower cross piece.&nbsp; 
      The swivel shaft holds the gear case at the correct angle.&nbsp; The 
      pinion tube length was determined from this drawing to be 3.5&quot;.&nbsp; 
      There is a little gap between the end of the pinion tube and&nbsp; the 
      universal.&nbsp; Shim washers will be used 
      between the bearing and the universal to remove any slack.&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

              The upper side is cut at a 1&quot; radius to match with the tube.&nbsp;
