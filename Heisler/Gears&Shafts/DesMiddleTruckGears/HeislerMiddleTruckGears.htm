      <p align="left">&nbsp;<p align="left">The middle truck uses the same gear case as the outside 
      trucks.&nbsp; A line shaft is added to the middle truck to connect between the 
      engine and the tender 
      truck.&nbsp; The line shaft connects to the middle truck pinion shaft via 
      a pair of spur gears contained in the added gear box. (Note: 
      The <b>bevel gears</b> are in the <b>Gear Case</b>&nbsp; and the <b>spur 
      gears</b> are in the <b>Gear Box</b>.) The following 
      two drawings show the organization of the middle truck gear system. (Note 
      that the tender is on the left side of the drawing.)<p align="left"><b>
        Update August 2005: </b>The initial design used a piece of 
        3.5&quot; square tube for the gear box.&nbsp; After I built that design I 
        decided the gear box was way out of proportion (photo in the 
        construction section).&nbsp; I then redid this page using an oval design 
        that I previously thought would be too difficult to fabricate.&nbsp; It turned out it was 
        much easier to fabricate (using round tubes) than the square tube version 
        because the tubes make it fairly easy to keep the shafts, bearings and 
        gears all in alignment.&nbsp;&nbsp; 


      <p align="left">&nbsp;<p align="left">

        <img border="0" src="MiddleTruckSideView.jpg" width="720" height="300"><p align="left"><b>Pinion Tube: </b>The pinion tube is a length of 1.75&quot; 
      OD 1.25&quot; ID tube, the same as for the outside trucks.&nbsp; The 
        pinion tube is longer in the middle truck than in the outside trucks.&nbsp; 
        It is horizontal in the middle truck whereas it angles up 
        in the outside trucks.&nbsp; The pinion 
        tube is silver soldered to the front end of the gear box.&nbsp; The 
        pinion tube slides into the gear case small tube and is held in place 
        by a screw through the gear case small tube into the pinion tube. &nbsp; A notch is cut into the bottom of 
        the pinion tube for the swivel shaft bearing block. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


      <p align="left"><b>Gear Box:</b> The Gear Box&nbsp; contains the spur 
      gears that link the line shaft to the pinion shaft.&nbsp; The gear box is  
      fabricated from&nbsp; a pair of 2.25&quot; diameter steel tubes and 0.125&quot; 
      thick bar stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Pinion Shaft: </b>The pinion shaft is a length of 5/8&quot; 
      diameter mild steel rod.&nbsp; The only machining required is cutting key 
      slots in each end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Pinion Bearings: </b>The pinion shaft bearings are
      R10-2RS double sealed ball bearings. This bearing has a&nbsp; 5/8&quot;
      ID and 1 3/8&quot; OD and 11/32&quot; thick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


      <p align="left"><b>Line Shaft: </b>The line shaft is a length of 5/8&quot; 
      diameter mild steel rod.&nbsp; The only machining required is cutting key 
      slots in each end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Line Shaft Bearings: </b>The pinion shaft bearings are
      R10-2RS double sealed ball bearings, the same as used on the pinion shaft.. This bearing has a&nbsp; 5/8&quot;
      ID and 1 3/8&quot; OD and 11/32&quot; thick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


      <p align="left"><b>Line Shaft Bearing Block: </b>The line shaft bearing 
      block steadies the rear of the line shaft&nbsp;and attaches to the closed 
      end of the gear 
      case. </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Spur Gears: </b>The pair of spur gears in the gear box 
      are 14.5 degree pressure angel 18 tooth 12 pitch with 1.5&quot; pitch diameter and 1.67&quot; OD 
      unhardened steel.&nbsp; The 
      gears have a 5/8&quot; bore, 3/4&quot; face and 1.25&quot; overall length.&nbsp; 
      Both&nbsp; Boston Gear ND18-B and Martin S1218&nbsp; match these 
      specifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; The gears need to be broached for a 3/16&quot; key 
      and tapped for a 10-32 setscrew.</p>


      <p align="left"><b>Swivel Shaft: </b>&nbsp;The swivel shaft for the middle 
      truck is attached to the pinion tube whereas it screws to the small tube 
      of the gear case on the outside trucks.&nbsp; The same swivel shaft 
      bearing block is used for all three trucks.&nbsp; In the middle truck, the 
      pinion tube is notched to make room for the bearing block.</p>

      <p align="left">The sketch above is a section taken through the center of 
      the line and pinion shafts showing the gear and and bearing configuration.&nbsp; 
      Since the line shaft is positioned above the pinion shaft, the plane of 
      the drawing is not horizontal.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a much smaller gap 
      between the gears and the bearings than show in the drawing ---- shaft end 
      float will be about 0.01&quot;.&nbsp; If necessary, shim washers can be used to 
      reduce the shaft end float to 0.10&quot;.</p>
