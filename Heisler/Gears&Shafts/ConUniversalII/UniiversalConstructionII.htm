      The photo above shows one of the drive shafts.&nbsp; It has a good 
      resemblance with the prototype shaft.&nbsp; Making the middle part 
      slightly smaller than the ends is worthwhile.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, one 
      might not notice the shaft on the finished model unless they are run over 
      by it. </font></p>
