      The wheels had just been machined and painted so it was possible to finish the gear cases 
      and associated axels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            shafts<b> </b>hadn't been made so that was the first task.&nbsp; For 
            the bases, 3/4&quot; square 
            brass bar was used rather that the 5/8&quot; wide bar stock 
            specified in the design section.&nbsp; 
            The photo shows using a boring head to cut the 1&quot; radius on the 
            base. Note that the block is positioned at an angle (10 degrees) in 
            the vise.&nbsp; A similar technique was used to cut the 7/8&quot; radius 
            in the base for the middle truck swivel shaft (HM 317)</td>

            <td width="50%">Pieces of 5/16&quot; drill rod were silver soldered in 
            holes in the the bases. The bases were then attached to the gear 
            cases with a couple 6-32 screws.&nbsp; These screws went through 
            the gear case but not the pinion tube (the screws were ground flat 
            inside the gear case tube using a small grinding wheel in the 
            Dremel).&nbsp; There is no reason for the swivel shafts on the 
            outside trucks to ever be removed so the attachment is considered 
            permanent. The photo shows the swivel shaft on a gear case after it was painted (powder 
            coated).&nbsp;
            <p>A 6-32 screw was used to secure the pinion tube at the gear case. 
            The top of the screw head is visible near the top of the photo.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>The wheels - spacers - wheel bearings were installed using the 
            same techniques as used for the non geared axels.&nbsp; See
            <a href="../../Trucks/ConWheels/ConWheels.htm">Wheel Construction</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
