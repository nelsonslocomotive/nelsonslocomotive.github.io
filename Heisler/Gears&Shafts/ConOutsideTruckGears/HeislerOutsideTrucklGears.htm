      <p align="left">Recall that the gear design required more iterations 
      than any other part of the design.&nbsp; &nbsp; We'll see if all that work 
      pays off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Refer to the

      If I could accomplish that task, the rest should be straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      protruding weld bead on the inside and the outside was not perfectly round.&nbsp; 
      The outside was turned down slightly to get a round surface and the inside 
      was bored to 3.1&quot; which removed the weld bead. &nbsp; Photo at right

      The fabrication of the next two gear cases went much faster once I knew 
      the design actually worked.&nbsp; It's much easier to machine identical 
      parts at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I purchased the bevel gears from 
      Applied Industrial Technologies which has outlets throughout&nbsp; the US 
      (~ $300 for the six gears --- ouch!).&nbsp;&nbsp; I purchased the ball bearings from Enco ---- they are Chinese but seem to be of good quality and the price 
      was right.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left">
      The gear case worked out more or less as planned.&nbsp; The tubes make it 
      easy to keep the shafts, bearings and gears all in alignment.&nbsp; 
      It's on to the middle truck gears next.</p>
