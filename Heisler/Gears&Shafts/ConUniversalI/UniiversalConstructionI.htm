        strong enough to take reasonable depth cuts is about 1/4&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
        have a 3/32&quot; key slot broach that did the Shay wheels and gears and also 
        the Heisler wheels and gears and is still reasonably sharp.&nbsp; I 
        decided to try to use it to remove the 1/8&quot; radius fillets in the
