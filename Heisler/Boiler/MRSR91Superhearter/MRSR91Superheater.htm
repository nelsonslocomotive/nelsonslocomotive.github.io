      <p>The two major features of the Heisler West Coast Special are the
      piston valves and the superheater.&nbsp;&nbsp; The superheater is
      described in this page..</p>

              Heisler run from the back of the steam dome to the upper edge of the steam
              chests.&nbsp; With the superheater, the
              steam lines run from the upper rear of the smoke box to the
              front of the cylinder castings. This photo shows the right side elbow at the
              smoke box feeding into an insulated pipe that leads to the right
              cylinder.&nbsp; The small tubing is an oil feed that connects to a
              check valve that is attached to the elbow. The left side&nbsp; has
              an identical configuration. The plate directly
              below the smoke stack is the Superheater tag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            <td width="50%"><b>Snifter Valve:</b> The ~ 1&quot; pipe coming out
              the top of the large steam feed elbow was a puzzle at first but
              then I guessed it went to a shared snifter valve.&nbsp; The curved
              pipe that follows the smoke box surface is the air pump exhaust
              that runs along the top of the smoke box and then vertically just
              behind&nbsp; the smokestack.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ~1&quot; pipe out the top
              of the elbow connects to an identical pipe on the other
              side.&nbsp; There is a tee at the middle of this connection that
              in turn connects to the check valve on top of the smoke box&nbsp;
              That's the check valve under the
              front edge of the disk in the photo.&nbsp; The other end of
              the&nbsp; check valve is connected via the tee to the vertical
              part of the air pump exhaust.&nbsp; The check valve provides the
              snifter valve function serving both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; That disk
              is a puzzle ------&nbsp; maybe the crew uses it to warm their
              pizza.&nbsp;</td>

              petticoat is right in the middle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that there is a gap
              between the top of the petticoat tube and the bottom of the
              smokestack.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>The bent tubes to the rear of the petticoat are the superheater
              tubes.</p>

              a hole cut in the bottom of the smoke box.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is
              probably the blower pipe on the right side.</td>

              tubes are U-shaped and run from a manifold at the top of the smoke
              box down and then take a 90 degree turn and go into large boiler
              tubes.&nbsp; I didn't think to look into the firebox end of those
              tubes to see if I could tell how far back the superheater tubes
              run before they double back.&nbsp; The two ends of each
              superheater tube are held to the manifold by brackets,&nbsp; bolts
              and Tee nuts in a slot in the manifold.&nbsp;</td>

              Heisler.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petticoat and all tubes have been removed
              exposing the manifold and tube sheet.&nbsp; There are a total of 10 large boiler tubes for
              10 superheater
              tubes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The output pipes to the cylinders come off each
              end of the manifold.&nbsp; The throttle valve is in the steam
              dome.&nbsp; A pipe from the throttle valve feeds the back side of
              the manifold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              manifold.&nbsp;&nbsp; No luck on that point.&nbsp; It's my guess
              that the 10 superheater tubes are in parallel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            <td width="50%">This photo was taken through one of the holes in the
              front tube sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pipe is the feed pipe from the
              throttle valve to the superheater manifold.&nbsp; The steam dome
              cover was off letting sunlight illuminate the elbow and
              flanges at the back end of the pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper flange
              is part of the throttle valve.&nbsp; The two rods on the upper 
            right are stays for the
              front tube sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a similar set on the other
              side.
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The current plan is to model a much simpler (and less effective)
              superheater.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One possibility is to merely make a
              couple loops of the steam feed lines in the rear part of the smoke
              box.&nbsp;</p>
