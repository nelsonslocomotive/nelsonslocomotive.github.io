                spring of 2003 we found that the boiler had been removed from Cass 6 and
                was on the floor of the shop as shown on the right.&nbsp; A
                new boiler had been installed on the locomotive&nbsp;
                <p><b>Spring 2004:&nbsp; </b>On a subsequent trip in the spring
                of 2004 we found that the old boiler had been moved to a flat car as shown
                below.&nbsp;&nbsp; On that trip I took a few photos and measured
                the major sections of the boiler.&nbsp; It was a good thing I did because in
                June 2004, the boiler was gone.</td>
