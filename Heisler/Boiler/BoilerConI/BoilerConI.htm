        <strong>Firebox Door:&nbsp; </strong>The firebox door was constructed

        The handles were made much larger than shown in the design drawing and 
		very much out of scale as are the engineer's fingers.&nbsp; The base is 
		attached with 4-40 screws into 1/8&quot; deep holes into the boiler back 
		head.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pair of (#2) screws in the boiler side of the door 
		serve as stops for the damper plate.&nbsp;

				There is a 1/4&quot; OD brass tube inside the nut that has a 1/2&quot; 
				diameter flange below the nut and 1/4-40 threads above the nut.&nbsp; 
				The glass is sealed with 3/8&quot; ID- 1/2&quot; OD Viton O Rings at each

				<br>The two valves screwed into the boiler are 1/4&quot; and the blow 
				down valve is 3/16&quot;&nbsp; Note the positioning of the valves.&nbsp; 
				Each valve and pipe to the boiler can be tested by closing the 
				other boiler valve and opening the blow down.&nbsp; The&nbsp; 
				differential pressure across the water glass in only a few 
				ounces so the pipes &amp; valve can be easily plugged by a bit of 
				debris.&nbsp; Hence, I try to remember to test the water gauge 
				plumbing each time I fire up. </td>

        <strong>Steam Plumbing:&nbsp; </strong>The initial pan was to have a 
		separate webpage section for the steam plumbing.&nbsp; However, I since 
		decided to to describe the steam manifold here and to describe the 
		individual runs from the manifold with the description of the appliance 
		on the other end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style7">
        The photo above shows the plumbing from the steam dome to the steam 
		manifold.&nbsp; The&nbsp; tees, 1/4&quot; valve and compression fittings are 
		standard plumbing fittings from McMaster-Carr.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the 
		valve can cut off the&nbsp;whistle and the steam manifold for 
		maintenance.&nbsp; The&nbsp; pressure gauge is before the valve so that 
		it can't be cut off.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style7">
        The manifold is made from a 4&quot; length of 1/2&quot; square brass bar stock.&nbsp; 
		It was drilled lengthwise and the ends tapped 1/4-40.&nbsp; Three holes 
		were drilled and tapped 3/16&quot;-40 in the top.&nbsp; (There is room for 
		additional ports if required.)&nbsp; The stub out the back is 1/8&quot; NPT.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Two 6-32 studs extend out the front.&nbsp; The studs and stub out the 
		back were silver soldered to the manifold.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<table style="width: 100%">

				<td class="style2">The manifold is attached to the support plate 
				(1/8&quot; X 4' W X 4.754&quot; H HRS) via the two studs.&nbsp; The stay 
				tubes were tapped 7/16-40 and fitted with 7/16-20 to 6-32 brass 
				bushing.&nbsp; The pair of screws&nbsp; near the bottom of the 
				support plate are into these bushings. <br><br>The support plate 
				is very sturdy with the screws in the bottom and the tube to 
				the steam dome steadying the top.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a handy place to 
				hang the pressure gauge bracket and a bushing for the throttle 
				shaft.&nbsp; </td>

				described in the Water Plumbing section.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
				mentioned here because the coils appear in the background of 
				some of the photos of the inside of the smoke box.&nbsp; Water 
				enters the heater through the side of the boiler tube in the 
				lower right of the photo.&nbsp; This is on the smoke box side of 
				the front tube sheet so this is unpressurized. The output of the 
				feed water heater is via a 1/4&quot; tube compression to&nbsp; 1/8&quot; 
				NPT fitting on the middle right of the photo.&nbsp; This fitting 
				goes screws into the front tube sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two 
				bolts are 3/8&quot;-24 threaded into the ends of the stay tube --- 
				it's a sloppy fit but OK for these light duty supports.&nbsp; &nbsp;
