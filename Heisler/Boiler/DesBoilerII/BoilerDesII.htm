		</span> </b><span class="style3">The sketch below shows the overall throttle layout.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This is very similar to the arrangement in the late Heisler prototype where the 
        throttle valve is located in the steam dome and the output steam pipe from 
        the throttle is routed through the top of the boiler to the smoke box.&nbsp; The 
        throttle valve for the Schroeder Shay is also located in the steam dome.&nbsp; 
        The valve has been in my Shay for 6 
        years with no trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design shown here will allow all the 
        throttle plumbing to be removed for maintenance.&nbsp; However, the smoke box 
        will probably have to be slid off the front of the boiler to access the 
        throttle and some of the superheater fittings in the smoke box.&nbsp;

        <p align="left" class="style3"><font face="Arial">The 
        throttle valve is a simple 3/8&quot; full port brass valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        throttle valve, nipple and the elbow are assembled 
        outside the boiler and lowered into the steam chamber.&nbsp; The long 
        3/8&quot; pipe is inserted through the fitting in the front tube sheet and 
        screwed into the elbow below the throttle valve.&nbsp; The long 3/8&quot; pipe is 
        ~ 0.675&quot; OD and ~0.475&quot; ID.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 3/4&quot; OD sleeve 
		with 3/4&quot; hex on the end is soldered to 
        the outside of the 3/8&quot; pipe to enlarge the OD to match with the 3/4&quot; compression fitting in the front 
        tube sheet.&nbsp; A short length of 1/2&quot; OD tube is soldered to the 
		inside of the pipe with about 1/2&quot; extending beyond the end of the hex.&nbsp; 
		This tube matches with the 1/2&quot; tube compression elbow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		3/4 hex can be used to grasp the pipe to screw it into the elbow 
        below the throttle valve.&nbsp; The throttle linkage will be connected after 
        the throttle valve is installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>

            <p class="style3"><font face="Arial">The throttle rod is 3/16&quot; diameter stainless steel.&nbsp; 
            The plan was to put a packing gland for the throttle rod on the 
            outside of the steam chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it was&nbsp; observed 
            that the rod must bend vertically about 0.3&quot; as the throttle 
            lever 
            is rotated.&nbsp; There is a concern that this amount of flexing 
            might cause the packing to leak.&nbsp;&nbsp; An alternative is to run the throttle rod through a length of 1/4&quot; pipe 
            with the gland at the end of the pipe.&nbsp; The pipe gives the rod 
            room to flex. </font> </p>

            valve after everything is positioned correctly.&nbsp; </span> </font>

			<p class="style2"><span class="style3"><strong>Note:&nbsp; After the throttle valve was 
			positioned in the model it was decided to rotate the throttle 
			bracket 90 degrees and secure it to the left side of the steam 
			dome instead of the back as shown on the drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			The fabrication of the bracket should be deferred until the throttle 
			is installed so that it can be made to match the exact position of 
			the valve.</strong></span><font face="Arial"><span class="style3"><strong>&nbsp;

        <span class="style4">Superheater:&nbsp; </span><span class="style3">The late Heislers had superheaters so I want

        superheaters were considered: </span> </font> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        <p align="left">
        <font face="Arial"><span class="style3">&nbsp;Coil the steam line around the inside of the smoke box to get some 
        additional heating. The advice from several experienced live steamers 
        was that it's not worth the effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

		<span class="style3">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left">
        <font face="Arial"><span class="style3">A second option is to run several small diameter superheater tubes down 
        some of the boiler tubes like the prototype.&nbsp; Ken Schroeder said he 
        has had success with this technique.&nbsp; He pointed out that the elbow 
        on the end of the tube would have to be welded, not silver soldered.&nbsp; 
        That sounded like a lot of work.&nbsp; However, the major objection to 
        this scheme is that the tubes will likely be plugged with soot from my 
        oil fire and quickly become useless.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken burns 
        propane which doesn't soot the tubes.</span><br class="style3">
		<span class="style3">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p align="left" class="style3">
        <font face="Arial">The third option is to loop the steam lines through 
        the firebox.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken Schroeder mentioned that he did this on one 
        of his locomotive and it was effective.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the option selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <font face="Arial">
        <img border="0" src="Superheater.jpg" width="750" height="469" class="style3"></font></p>
        <p align="left" class="style3"><font face="Arial">The sketch above shows the superheater tubes that carry 
        the steam from the smoke box to the inside of the fire box and then back to 
        the smoke box.&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle tube is the input from the 
        throttle.&nbsp;&nbsp; The outside tubes are the output, one feeding each 
        cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1/2&quot; OD stainless steel tubes slide 
        inside the 5/8&quot; OD copper boiler tubes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        NPT fittings will be assembled outside the fire box using a high 
        temperature (1200 degree F) thread sealer.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The fittings will then be placed in the fire box, the tubes positioned 
        in the compression fittings and the fittings then tightened.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The compression fittings are used to make it easy to assemble the 
        superheater, not for ease of disassembly.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unlikely 
        that the tubes can be removed from the compression fittings without 
        damage.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a superheater tube has to be removed from the 
        boiler tube, the end of the super heater tube with the compression sleeve and nut 
        will probably have to be cut off.&nbsp; Hopefully the superheater will 
        need to be assembled only once.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tubes and fittings 
        will probably glow red when there throttle is closed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
        will 
        be necessary to put a fixture in the fire box to support 
        the fittings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

            brass pipe from the throttle valve is in the upper middle.&nbsp; All 
            the other pipes are 1/2&quot; OD tubes with compression fittings.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            One requirement is that a brush can be used on all flue tubes without 
            removing any of the plumbing.&nbsp; The top row of boiler tubes are 
            partially behind the compression nuts but it is possible to get the
