        <strong>Smoke Box Drilling: </strong>&nbsp;The smoke box is simply a 
		8.5&quot; length of 8&quot; OD 1/4&quot; wall steel tube with lots of holes.&nbsp; The 
		first thing I did was to mount the tube in the lathe and square up the 
		ends.&nbsp; Next, about 0.01&quot; was turned off the inside where it slips 
		over the boiler tube to make it easier to slide the two&nbsp; pieces 
		together. </p>
		<p align="left" class="style2">
        The most difficult part of drilling the holes is to get them positioned 
		accurately.&nbsp;&nbsp; The big hole for the smokestack was started with 
		a 1&quot; step drill and then finished with a boring head in the mill.&nbsp; 
		The holes for the blast nozzle and the steam supply to the cylinders 
		were made with a step drill.( Step drills are much easier to use than 
		regular drills for large holes in relatively thin material and 
		especially thin curved surfaces.) </p>
		<p align="left" class="style2">
        The photo shows using a template to drill the rivet holes near the back 
		of the tube.&nbsp; The template hole locations were center drilled in 
		the 1/8&quot; X 1/4&quot; CFS bar on the mill using the digital 
		indexing.&nbsp; The holes were then drilled 
		through on the drill press.&nbsp; The bar was then heated and bend 
		around the end of the boiler to get the curved shape.&nbsp; The template 
		was clamped to the smokestack tube and the first hole drilled through 
		the tube.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rivets&nbsp; will be #2 drive screws so # 3 
		screws will fit in the holes.&nbsp; After the first hole was drilled, a 
		screw was inserted in the hole, nut attached and tightened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hole 
		is then drilled&nbsp; at the other end of the string of holes and a 
		screw put through that hole.&nbsp; With both ends of the template 
		secured with screws, the remaining holes in the template were drilled 
		through.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; template was removed and repositioned at 
		the end of the first set of holes with a screw through the last hole 
		in the template and through the end hole in the smoke box.&nbsp; The 
		process was started at the top and holes drilled down both sides with 
		the meeting point at the middle bottom where the different spacing 
		between the last rivets won't be noticed. </p>

		<p align="left" class="style2">
        <strong>Throttle:</strong>&nbsp; The photo above shows the throttle 
		valve and associate plumbing.&nbsp; The throttle valve is located in the 
		steam dome.&nbsp; The long pipe runs from the valve above the flues and 
		through the front tube sheet into the smoke box.&nbsp; The valve, the 
		street elbow and the short pipe out the top of the valve is inserted 
		through the top of the steam dome.&nbsp; The long pipe is inserted 
		through the front tube sheet and threaded into the street elbow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		All these fittings are 3/8&quot; brass pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style2">
        The right end of the long pipe has been modified.&nbsp;&nbsp; A short 
		piece of 3/4&quot; hex bar stock was turned to 3/4&quot; diameter with about 1/2&quot; 
		of the hex left on the end.&nbsp;&nbsp; The center was drilled to 5/8&quot;.&nbsp; 
		The OD of the end of the 3/8&quot; pipe was turned down from about 0.675&quot; to 
		5/8&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 3/4&quot; OD piece with the hex end was then silver 
		soldered onto the turned down end of the pipe.&nbsp; The 3/4&quot; OD of the 
		end fits into a 3/4&quot; compression tube in the front tube sheet.&nbsp; 
		The stop in the inside of the compression fitting was drilled out so 
		that the 3/4&quot; OD of the modified pipe will slide all the way through the 
		fitting. The compression fitting seals the pipe.&nbsp; The 3/4&quot; hex on the end is 
		used to screw the pipe into the street elbow under the valve.&nbsp; 
		The last modification to the end was to drill the end 1/2&quot; (the 3/8&quot; 
		pipe has a ID slightly less than 1/2&quot; ID) about 3/4&quot; deep and to silver 
		solder a piece of 1/2&quot; OD tube into the end with about 1/2&quot; extending 
		beyond the hex piece.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 1/2&quot; OD tube on the end fits into 
		a compression fitting that connects to the superheater tubes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The large hex fitting&nbsp; on the right end in the photo is the 
		compression nut.&nbsp; Tthe 3/4&quot; hex is visible to the right of the nut 
		and the short 1/2&quot; OD tube to the right of the 3/4&quot; hex.&nbsp; The challenge with making this piece is to get the length right as there 
		is little room for variation. </p>
