        <strong><span class="style10">Sand Dome:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span class="style10"> The 
				sand dome uses Allen Models aluminum castings part # M221/2.&nbsp; There 
				are two castings, the base and the top.&nbsp;&nbsp; The user 
				must supply a tube that fits between the two pieces.&nbsp; A ~2.75&quot; length 
		of 3&quot; steel pipe with the OD turned down from 
				about 3.5&quot; to about 3.35&quot; was used for the tube. A 
		short stub was turned on both castings such that the tube was a snug 
		fit over the stub.&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp; plate was welded across the tube 
		and the tube was secured to the bottom casting with a couple 4-40&nbsp; 
		screws as shown in the photo.&nbsp; Note that the tube appears to have 
		part of the side cut out in the photo -- that is an illusion possibly 
		caused by part of the flash being blocked.&nbsp; The dome is secured by 
		a 3/8&quot; threaded rod through the center hole of the plate into a nut welded 
		onto the top of the boiler; a coupling nut is used on the upper end of 
		the rod.&nbsp; A second threaded rod is secured to the top casting as 
		shown in the photo.&nbsp;&nbsp; That second rod with top attached is 
		screwed into the upper end of the coupling nut.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

        <strong>Changes to pipes out of rear of steam dome: </strong>&nbsp;In 
		the original design and construction the two 1/4&quot; NPT couplings at the 
		bottom rear of the steam dome were fitted with 3/8&quot; compression 
		adapters, one for a 3/8&quot; tube to supply steam to the steam manifold and 
		the other to house a O-Ring seal for the 3/16&quot; throttle rod; see&nbsp;
		<a href="../BoilerConII/BoilerConII.htm">Boiler Construction II</a>.&nbsp; 
		These compression adapters were too bulky, the holes required through 
		the&nbsp; steam dome cover would be too large and there was insufficient 
		room for the boiler jacket and insulation to slide underneath.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		These problems were solved by inserting 1/4&quot; NPT to 1/8&quot; NPT bushings in 
		the couplings in the steam dome and screwing 1/8&quot; NPT stainless pipe 
		nipples into the bushings, see photo above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		upper pipe in the photo is the steam supply line.&nbsp; On the very left 
		of the photo a piece of hex is visible; the hex was silver soldered to the 
		pipe to provide a means to install and remove the pipe from the steam 
		dome.&nbsp; The end of 1/8&quot; pipe was turned down to 3/8&quot; just beyond the hex so 
		that it would fit into the 3/8&quot; tube compression fitting used in the 
		previous arrangement.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Compression fittings are large but 
		much smaller than and less expensive than unions and seem to seal better.)&nbsp; 
		The 3/16&quot; throttle rod of the original design was too stiff to easily flex as necessary between 
		the coupling in the side of the steam dome and the throttle lever.&nbsp; 
		The solution was to reduce the throttle&nbsp;rod to 1/8&quot; diameter to 
		make it more flexible.&nbsp; The rod is run through the 1/8&quot; pipe which 
		serves both to limit the flexing of the rod and to move the bulky 
		compression adapter used to hold the seal to the rear and into the cab.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The photo below&nbsp;shows the rear part of the 1/8&quot; pipes.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a much improved design; wished I'd thought of it the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <strong>Steam Dome Cover: </strong>The steam dome cover uses Allen 
		Models aluminum castings part #M219/2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The center part of 
		the cover is a ~2.5&quot; length of 5&quot; OD 4.5&quot; ID aluminum tube 
		purchased separately.&nbsp; Very 
		short stubs were turned on the castings that were a snug fit to the ID 
		of the tube.&nbsp;&nbsp; A slight taper was turned on the outside of the tube 
		to match the slightly smaller OD of the upper casting.&nbsp; The&nbsp; 
		lower casting was attached to the tube with 4-40 screws as shown in 
		photo above.&nbsp; (Note that part of the side of aluminum tube appears 
		to missing in the photo; that is an illusion.)&nbsp; The slots for the 
		pair of 1/8&quot; pipes extending out the back were then cut through the 
		bottom casting and part way into the aluminum tube.&nbsp; The cover is 
		held in place&nbsp; by a pair of screws through the top into threaded 
		spacers secured to the top of the steam dome as shown in a previous 
		photo.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cover in turn holds the lower part in position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <strong>&nbsp;Boiler Jacket:&nbsp; </strong>The jacket was made of 24 gauge 
		(.024&quot;) stainless steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was cut and rolled on a 3-in-1 
		brake, shear, rolling tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Shearing the stainless was hard 
		on the shear blades and dulled them to the point that they need to be 
		replaced - replacement at ~$80/blade appears to be cheaper then having 
		them sharpened.&nbsp; 26 gauge would have probably worked as well and been 
		easier to cut.)&nbsp;&nbsp; A double layer of 1/8&quot; self adhesive cork 
		sheets (McMaster) were used for lagging.&nbsp; Spacers/supports for under 
		the jacket were made of ~ 3/4&quot; wide rings sawed off the scrap from the 
		fire box tube (rounded part of boiler) and 1/4&quot; square bar stock for the 
		flat section parts.&nbsp; These spacers were positioned under the jacket 
		joints and just in front of the cab.&nbsp; (The very front of the jacket 
		rests on the rear of the smoke box tube.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spacers 
		were tack welded to the boiler - in hindsight, high temperature epoxy 
		would probably been a better alternative than welding.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style2">
        &nbsp;The assembly process was to first join the boiler and the smoke box 
		with&nbsp; 4 - 1/4&quot; FH screws.&nbsp;&nbsp; The screws go though holes in 
		the rear part of the smoke box tube into threaded holes in the boiler 
		tube.&nbsp; &nbsp; (The holes are in front of the front tube sheet so no leaks 
		but behind the front edge of the jacket so they are not visible.) &nbsp; 
		Next, the spacers were attached.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the cork sheets were 
		cut and pressed into position between the spacers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The stainless jacket pieces were then cut and attached.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
		pattern of heavy paper was made for the center section to help in the 
		cutting and fitting.&nbsp; Unfortunately, no pictures were taken of 
		these steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        Photo above shows the finished jacket.&nbsp;&nbsp; The flange under the 
		boiler is about 1/2&quot; wide and the screws are 1&quot; long 6-32.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Longer screws were used in a couple spots initially until the jacket was 
		pulled tight.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a challenge to figure out a way to pull 
		the rear section tight.&nbsp; The lower part of the jacket over the side of 
		the firebox is behind the slotted frame stiffeners where there is very 
		little clearance and virtually no access.&nbsp; The solution was to make 
		the parts of the jacket behind the stiffeners separate pieces secured 
		with a couple&nbsp; button head cap screws at the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		3/16&quot; square brass bars were attached to the top of the flat part and 
		the bottom of the rounded part with 4-40 FH screws through the jacket 
		into the bars.&nbsp; Three 4-40 screws through clearance holes through 
		the upper bar into threaded holes in the lower bar tied 
		everything together and&nbsp;permitted the jacket to be tightened down.&nbsp; 
		The bars and gap are behind the upper frame bar and the upper part of 
		the stiffener and are not noticeable unless one is standing on their head.&nbsp; The walkways hide the top of the 
		brass bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bands are 0.020&quot; X 1/2&quot; stainless strip 
		stock (McMaster).</p>

        The two photos above show the smoke box front after the hinge and dogs 
		have been added.&nbsp; The upper photo was taken just after the hinge 
		and dogs were attached.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower photo was taken after the 
		locomotive had been operated for about 20 hours with the hinges and dogs 
		in place --- and it looks suitably dirty.&nbsp;&nbsp; This second photo 
		was taken from a different angle to show the depth of the hinge and dogs.&nbsp; 
		Originally, the hinge pieces were intended to be made from 1/4&quot; thick 
		bar stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After looking at the actual thickness of 
		the 1/4&quot; stock held against the smoke box front it was decided to cut 
		the width to 1/8' bar stock.&nbsp; The drawing in the Boiler Design III 
		page had been updated to reflect this change.&nbsp; 1/8&quot; wide slots were 
		milled into the cast iron smoke box front for the hinge parts which were 
		secured with high temperature epoxy.&nbsp; </p>

        <strong>Smoke Box Door Dogs:&nbsp; </strong>The design of the dogs in 
		the drawing above was settled on after several trials of slightly 
		different dimensions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dogs were machined on the 
		ends of&nbsp; length of 0.25&quot; X 0.22&quot; bar stock milled down from 0.25&quot; 
		square stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step was to make rough saw cuts for 
		the larger notch on the end.&nbsp;&nbsp; That big notch was smoothed on 
		the mill and the second smaller notch cut on the mill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The hole was then located and drilled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the bar was 
		held in the vise and the edges rounded to resemble a casting using a 
		small sanding drum in a rotary tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog was then 
		sawed off the bar stock and the saw marks smoothed with the sanding 
		drum.&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes a while to get setup to make the first one, 
		after that it goes pretty quickly.&nbsp; I made a dog at each end of the 
		bar to speed up the process.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dogs are secured with 4-40 
		studs (held in place by Loctite)&nbsp; and nuts. </p>
