		tube used for the smoke box.&nbsp; The base is much wider than 
		absolutely necessary so that the two attachment screws can be accessed 
		easily.&nbsp;&nbsp; The blower line feeds through the smoke box wall via the angled 3/16&quot; tube to female 1/8&quot; NPT fitting&nbsp; 
		on the inside to a straight 
		3/16&quot; tube to 1/8&quot; male NPT fitting on the outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		the saddle as a pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those holes that couldn't be 
		drilled that way were marked using the holes in the saddle as a 
		template.&nbsp; </p>
