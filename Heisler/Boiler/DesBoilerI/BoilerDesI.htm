        <p><span class="style3"><strong><span class="style5">Update 2/26/10:
		</span> </strong><span class="style5">The baffle originally shown on this 
		page was not made as part of the boiler.&nbsp; Instead, the baffle was made part 
		of the fire pan.&nbsp;&nbsp; This page was updated to reflect this 
		change. 
		</span></span> </p>
		<p class="style4">There is plenty of data on Heisler boilers in the 
        reference sections so it would be a simple matter to create an exact 
        scale boiler.&nbsp; However, on my Shay, the limitation is the ability 
        to generate steam so I want to make the Heisler capable of generating as 
        much steam as possible.&nbsp; The Heisler engine is about 50 % 
        more powerful than the Shay engine so I want to be able to generate at 
        least 50% more steam and preferably about twice as much steam. </p>
        <p class="style4">Apparently the firebox size is the major factor 
        determining the amount of steam generated.&nbsp; Tests on the Shay 
        revealed that there was a maximum amount of oil fuel that could be 
        burned.&nbsp; Additional fuel beyond this maximum causes the fire to 
        shoot out any small opening like a blast furnace.&nbsp; My guess is that 
        maximum amount of fuel that can be consumed and hence the maximum steam that can be generated is proportional to the 
        firebox volume.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="style4">The boiler and hence the firebox width is limited by the 8.5&quot; 
        distance between the diamond frame members.&nbsp; I'd like to use 1/4&quot; 
        cork insulation and have a thin jacket so the maximum width (OD) of the 
        boiler is about 7.75&quot;&nbsp; Ken Schroeder&nbsp; used 6&quot; pipe (6.625&quot; OD) 
        for his Shay boiler.&nbsp; Seven inch pipe (7.625&quot; OD) could be 
        used but doesn't appear to be readily available.&nbsp; I was able to obtain a piece of 
        7.5&quot; OD, 7&quot; ID seamless steel tube.&nbsp; The tube is more expensive 
        than pipe but is also has more controlled dimensions (it's round) than 
        the typical piece of pipe.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="style4">With the tube diameter determined I then sketched out a number of 
        different boiler configurations.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ended up pretty much 
        copying&nbsp; Ken's Shay boiler design with the larger diameter and 
        somewhat greater length.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the basic configuration 
        was selected, it was adjusted to maximize the firebox size while staying pretty 
        close to scale dimensions.&nbsp; The back of the boiler is a bit over 
        scale in length.&nbsp; Most of the additional length is inside the cab.&nbsp; 
        The cab was also made a bit longer than scale. The deviation from scale 
        is 10% or less except for the height at the back which is about 15% over 
        scale.&nbsp; Ken Schroeder's shay boiler is quite a bit over scale 
        height and it&nbsp; worked out well.&nbsp;&nbsp; If one is concerned 
        about the deviation from scale, the height at the rear can be cut by 
        half inch to an inch with a corresponding reduction in the firebox 
        height and possibly eliminating one row of tubes --- or spacing the 
        tubes closer together.</p>
        <p><span class="style4">The final firebox size is 8.125&quot; H&nbsp; X&nbsp; 5.5&quot; W&nbsp; X&nbsp; 10.75&quot; L for a total 
        volume of 480 cubic inches.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shay firebox is 7.25&quot; H&nbsp; X&nbsp; 4.5&quot; W&nbsp; X &nbsp; 8&quot; L for a total volume</span><span class="style2">
		</span><span class="style4">of 261 cubic inches.&nbsp; 
        Hence, the Heisler firebox will be 184% of the Shay firebox.&nbsp; The 
        plan is to have both a superheater and a feed water heater that I hope 
        will contribute at least 10% each which should get the capability to the 
        200% desired. </span> </p>
        <p class="style4">The same type 5/8&quot; OD copper flue tubes that Ken used on 
        the Shay boiler were selected.&nbsp; Ken specified 21 tubes, each with length of 
        14.75&quot; between the tube sheets for a total effective length of 310&quot;.&nbsp; 
        My Shay boiler has a slightly different configuration with a total of 25 
        tubes at 14.75&quot; between the tube sheets for a total length of 369&quot;.&nbsp; 
        The Heisler boiler will have 31 tubes but 3 will be used for the 
        superheater so it will have 28 effective tubes, each with length 20.75&quot; 
        between the tube sheets for a total effective length of&nbsp; 581&quot;.&nbsp; 
        This works out to 187% of Ken's design and&nbsp; 157% of my Shay boiler.&nbsp; 
        I suspect this is more than adequate, especially if I work on the burner 
        design to minimize the total air flow through the firebox and tubes.</p>
        <p class="style4">The later Heisler throttle design with a valve in 
        the steam chamber was copied.&nbsp; The output of the valve goes into a pipe that 
        runs above the flue tubes, through the upper part of the front tube sheet into 
        the smoke box where it connects to the superheater.&nbsp; The 
        valve is controlled by a rod that exits the rear of the steam chamber 
        and runs along the top of the boiler into the cab, just like the 
        prototype.</p>
        <p class="style4">The smoke box on Ken's Shay boiler was merely a continuation of the 
        boiler tube (6&quot; pipe)&nbsp; When the boiler was lagged and jacketed the 
        boiler OD was 1/2&quot; larger diameter than the smoke box diameter, similar 
        to the prototype Shay.&nbsp; The Heisler smoke box has a larger diameter than 
        the boiler. When the lagging is added to the boiler the OD becomes the 
        same as the smoke box and the jacket covers the rear edge of the smoke 
        box and continues on back over the boiler lagging.&nbsp; I followed this 
        part of the prototype design by making the smoke box separate from the 
        boiler.&nbsp; The smoke box will be a length of 8&quot; OD - 7.5&quot; ID Tube.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The smoke box will be attached to the saddle which in turn will attach 
        to the frame.&nbsp; The front inch or so of the boiler will slide into 
        the smoke box tube but not be fastened.&nbsp; The rear of the boiler 
        will set on brackets attached to the frame.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="style4">The Shay steam turret is supplied via a 1/4&quot; NPT coupling welded 
        into the top rear 
        of the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; One problem I have with this 
        arrangement&nbsp; is getting water in the turret when going uphill.&nbsp; 
        My operating technique is to try to start up long hills with a full load of&nbsp; 
        water and full pressure.&nbsp; I can stop water input and use all 
        heat to generate steam on the up slope and then&nbsp;refill the boiler on 
        the flat or the downhill side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The up slope causes 
        the water level in the rear to rise and, if the fireman added too much 
        water, some goes into the steam turret.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the 
        Heisler,&nbsp; I decided to supply the turret from the steam chamber via a 1/4&quot; 
        pipe along the top of the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; The steam chamber is more 
        near the center and hence not as effected by the change in slope and it 
        is of course higher than the rest of the boiler. With this arrangement a 
        shutoff valve can be inserted between the steam chamber and the turret 
        --- a feature that several experienced live steamers have suggested.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
