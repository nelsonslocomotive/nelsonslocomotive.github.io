      <p align="left">A few days after finishing the the design of the axel pump 
      I strained my shoulder.&nbsp; This is  the time of the year when she 
      usually wants me to work in the yard.&nbsp; However, with the sore 
      shoulder I thought it best to rest and let it recover.&nbsp;&nbsp; There 
      was a constant mild pain so any distraction was welcome.&nbsp; Building the 
      axel pump turned out to be just the right distraction.&nbsp; (She didn't 
      buy it either).<p align="left">The design details are at:
        <a href="../DesAxelPump/AxelPump.htm">Axel Pump Design </a>.&nbsp; I had obtained all the parts  except the rear bearing&nbsp; to verify the design.&nbsp; So it was 
        off to the storeroom to find suitable material for the inner and outer 
        rings and cover plates.&nbsp; I found a scrap sheet of 0.090&quot; aluminum 
        that would work for the retainers.&nbsp; I had a short piece of 3&quot; OD 
        aluminum rod that could be turned down for the inner ring so I was ready 
        to start.<p align="left">&nbsp;<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
          <tr>
            <td width="50%"><b>Inner Ring: </b>&nbsp;I started by rough sawing 
            the retaining plate, attaching it to the end of the 3&quot; diameter rod 
            with three 6-32 FH screws and then turning the outer edge of the plate 
            to match the rod OD.&nbsp;
            <p>Next, the rod was mounted in the 4-jaw chuck and setup with an 
            offset of 0.375&quot;&nbsp; using a dial indicator (0.75&quot; total throw.)&nbsp; 
            The 0.75&quot; axel hole was drilled undersize and then bored to the 
            final size.&nbsp; The photo shows the boring setup.&nbsp; This 
            approach rather than just drilling the axel hole was used to assure 
            the hole was parallel to the sides of the ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

            <td width="50%">The next step was to move the rod to the 3-jaw 
            chuck, make sure it was mounted straight and then turn the outer surface 
            of the ring.&nbsp; After seeing the actual part I decided to reduce 
            the width of the inner ring from 0.875&quot; to 0.66&quot;.&nbsp; The 
            combined ring and retainer have a total width of 0.75&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            I also increased the OD from 1.875&quot; to 1.9&quot;&nbsp; 
            Photo shows turning the OD.&nbsp; The ring was sawed off the stock 
            and the other face then turned flat.</td>

            for the outer ring&nbsp; solder a stub to the ring for connecting the 
            pump shaft.&nbsp; However, the remaining end of 3&quot; OD aluminum rod 
            looked perfect for the ring.&nbsp; I altered the design so that the 
            OD was 3&quot; to give plenty of threads for the pump shaft.&nbsp; The 
            ring plus retainer width was increased to  .75&quot; to match the inner 
            ring.&nbsp; Ring ID was reduced from 2.125&quot; to 2.0&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Photo at right shows the finished outer ring pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            rather than by a retaining ring.&nbsp; 
            The housing width was reduced to 0.375&quot; in accordance with that 
            change.&nbsp; The photo shows two 4-40 screws with washers.&nbsp;The 
            retaining&nbsp; plate will be made later.&nbsp; A shallow slot was&nbsp; milled in the tee to help hold the 
            housing in alignment when the pieces were soldered together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p align="left"><b>Mount Spacer:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I deferred making the 
      mount spacer until the spacer length can be verified on an assembled 
      truck. I'll make that mount bearing retainer at that time too.&nbsp;

      assembled pump.<p align="center">

        <p align="left">
      The pump worked out more or less as planned and I'm very satisfied.&nbsp; 
      It should run for years with no maintenance.&nbsp; Looking at the 
      photos above, the only issue is that the outer eccentric ring seems larger 
      than it need be.&nbsp; I could probably mill 3/8&quot; off the top, bottom and 
      rear which would make it look much smaller.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


        <p align="left">
      I can put the pump away until the truck castings arrive. </p>
