      <p align="left">The Shay is equipped with a hand pump in the tender, an 
      axel pump and a steam powered pump (an air compressor arranged to pump 
      water).&nbsp;&nbsp; I rarely use the hand pump and will not be equipping 
      the Heisler with a hand pump.&nbsp; I want to use the steam powered pump 
      on the Heisler as a real air compressor for the brakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also 
      decided to provide an injector on the Heisler&nbsp;after seeing Dan 
      Sharon use his injector on his shay.&nbsp; The main source of feed water 
      on the Heisler will be the axel pump described here. </p>


      <p align="left">The Heisler is bigger than the shay so we'll need a bit 
      more pumping capacity.&nbsp; The shay axel pump has a&nbsp; 0.5&quot;&nbsp; 
      bore and a 0.625&quot; stroke for a 0.12 cubic inch volume per stroke.&nbsp; 
      For the Heisler, &nbsp;I'm shooting for about 50% increase or about 0.18 cubic 
      inch volume per 
      stroke.&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left">The axel pump on the Shay is on the middle truck.&nbsp; 
      The middle truck on the Heisler is a bit crowded with both the bevel and 
      spur gears so the pump has to go on the front truck or the tender truck.&nbsp; 
      I decided against using the tender truck so that I could eliminate the 
      high pressure tender-to-locomotive water line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the 
      low pressure line which will feed both the axel pump and injector will be 
      required. </p>

          <tr>
            <td width="50%">I was motivated to look at the axel pump design at 
            this time because the gear systems had just been built and I was able 
            to position the gears with the truck casting patterns before I sent them 
            to Charly Wilkins.&nbsp; The photo at right shows the view from the 
            geared axel side which is the most forward axel on 
            the front truck. The axel pump will be driven by an eccentric on the 
            axel between the gear case and the truck side.&nbsp; 
            The photo shows there is plenty of room.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after 
            fitting a model pump cylinder between the gear tube and the truck 
            side it was determined the cylinder would work best if fitted&nbsp;between the gear tube and the end of the lower cross as shown on 
            the photo.&nbsp; This requires that the drive shaft be offset 0.25&quot; 
            from 
            the center to give adequate clearance.&nbsp; This offset will not 
            adversely affect the drive system.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </td>

            <td width="50%">Spring loaded poppet check valves 
             
            were selected for the pump valves.&nbsp; 
            The photo shows two types of check valves, both with 1/8&quot; NPT ends.&nbsp; 
            The lower valve is <a href="http://www.mcmaster.com/">McMaster-Carr</a> 
            #&nbsp; 7768K15.&nbsp; I used this type valve in several places on 
            the Shay and have been very satisfied.&nbsp; The upper valve is 
            Clippard MJCV-1AA.&nbsp; I would normally use the smaller valve but 
            was concerned about back pressure from the small passage diameter in 
            that valve.&nbsp; The passage cross 
            section area of the Clippard valve is several times larger.&nbsp; 
            Valve outside dimensions are not an issue in this application so I chose the
            <a href="http://www.clippard.com/">Clippard</a> valve.&nbsp; As a 
            bonus, it's 
            about half the cost of the smaller valve.</td>

      <p align="left">I also decided to use a sealed ball bearing in the pump 
      eccentric to avoid lubrication and wear issues.&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left">The cylinder 
      configuration was the last remaining design issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dick 
      McCloy (Mill Creek Central RR)&nbsp; suggested that I should be able 
      to use one of the little Clippard cylinders.&nbsp; Dick uses 
      Clippard parts in car braking systems and I used a Clippard 
      regulator on the Shay steam atomizer feed to the burner.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
      checked the <a href="http://www.clippard.com/">Clippard</a> website 
      and found that several of their heavy duty Minimatic cylinders are rated for hydraulic use with a 
      2000 psi 
      hydraulic pressure rating.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The cylinders are of brass and stainless steel construction with Buna N 
      seals.&nbsp; The suitable cylinders are available in&nbsp; 9/16&quot; and&nbsp; 
      7/8&quot; bore and stokes ranging from one inch&nbsp; to several inches or 
      more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 9/16&quot; bore is the best match for the 
      axel pump application except that the output port is 1/16&quot; NPT which might 
      restrict flow and cause excessive back pressure when pumping at high speeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
      7/8&quot; bore cylinders which come with 1/8&quot; NPT ports were then 
      examined.&nbsp; 
      However, a 7/8&quot; cylinder with the check valves is a very tight fit in 
      the available space.&nbsp; 
      A second look at the 9/16&quot; cylinders revealed that one type has a port out 
      the back with sufficient material around the port so 
      that it can be enlarged to 1/8&quot; NPT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="H9Cylinder.jpg" width="700" height="200"></p>


      <p align="left">
      The Clippard H9S-1D shown above is the selected cylinder.&nbsp; The 
      drawing for many of the cylinders are available online but not for this 
      cylinder so the drawing was made from data in a Clippard hard catalogue.&nbsp; The cylinder has a stud mount on the front end 
      which won't be used..&nbsp; The cylinder is double acting with a port on each side of 
      the piston.&nbsp; Only the rear port will be used for this application; 
      the other port will remain open.&nbsp;&nbsp; That rear port will be 
      enlarged to 1/8&quot; NPT and used for the pump flow and also be 
      used to mount the cylinder. &nbsp; </p>


      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="Cylinder.jpg" width="700" height="205"></p>


      <p align="left">Photo above shows the H9S-1D cylinder.&nbsp; The cylinder 
      was mounted in the lathe 3-jaw chuck&nbsp; to enlarge the rear port.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brass tends to grab drill 
      bits so successive sizes of reamers were used to enlarge the hole to 
      11/32&quot; and the hole was then tapped 1/8&quot; NPT.&nbsp;&nbsp; The end plug was 
      unscrewed before removing the cylinder from the lathe chuck.&nbsp; The 
      cylinder and plug were carefully cleaned before reassembly. </p>


      <p align="left">The 9/16&quot; bore gives 0.25 cubic inches of volume per 1&quot; 
      stroke.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we're shooting for about 0.18 cubic inches 
      volume per stroke, we need a stoke of about 0.75&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The axel diameter is 0.875&quot;&nbsp; so the minimum&nbsp; diameter of the 
      eccentric for a 0.75&quot; stroke is 1.625&quot; (sum of axel diameter and 
      eccentric throw).&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is to use a 
      ball bearing between the eccentric&nbsp; (inner ring) and the strap (outer 
      ring).&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the minimum bearing ID is 1.625&quot;.&nbsp; The nearest 
      standard bearing ID sizes are 1.75&quot; and&nbsp; 45 mm (1.772&quot;).&nbsp; This 
      is&nbsp; fairly light duty and it is desirable to minimize the overall size of 
      the eccentric so the smallest ball size and resulting smallest width and 
      OD is desirable.&nbsp;&nbsp; The #6809 metric bearing with 45 mm 
      (1.772&quot;)&nbsp; ID,&nbsp; 58 mm (2.283&quot;) OD and 7mm (0.276&quot;) width seems to be 
      the best choice.&nbsp; The 6809 has a 600 lb rated load which should be 
      more then sufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The simplest arrangement seems to 
      be to screw the cylinder shaft directly into the eccentric outer ring and 
      provide a swivel mount at the rear of the cylinder..&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left">&nbsp;With all these decisions made we're now 
      ready for the detailed design.&nbsp; </p>

      be via the check valve under the cylinder since it is the higher of the two
