        <p class="style12">This page describes the plumbing of the system 
		that delivers water from the&nbsp; tank on the tender to the boiler via two separate pumps. </p>
		<p class="style6">
		<img height="423" src="WaterPlumbing.jpg" width="697" class="style11"></p>
		<p class="style12">The axel pump is intended to be the primary way that 
		water is injected into the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; The output of axel pump 
		goes through a check valve and then through the feed water heater in the 
		smoke box before entering the boiler through the front tube sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The bypass valve provides a way to adjust the axel pump output.&nbsp; 
		Partially opening the bypass valve will allow some of the pump output 
		flow to return to the input pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The test valve provides a 
		way to bleed off air in the pump and also provides a way to verify that 
		the axel pump is actually working. </p>
		<p class="style12">The electric pump is the backup system used to immediately 
		inject water into the boiler.&nbsp; The original plan was to 
		use an injector for this function but the electric pump is cheaper and 
		less hassle.&nbsp;&nbsp; The electric pump output goes through a piston 
		type check valve next to the pump and then onto a ball check valve on the 
		side of the boiler and then through a shutoff valve into the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style6">
		<img height="411" src="EP1.jpg" width="700" class="style11"></p>
		<p class="style12">This description starts with the electric pump because 
		the water input pipe that feeds both pumps is attached to it.&nbsp; The 
		pump is a&nbsp; SHURFLO Model 8000-543-290 typically&nbsp; The spec sheet is at&nbsp;
		<a href="http://www.depcopump.com/datasheets/shurflo/8000-543-290.pdf">
		http://www.depcopump.com/datasheets/shurflo/8000-543-290.pdf&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;. 
		The pump operates from 12 volts DC and will deliver about 1 gallon per 
		minute at 100 psi pressure.&nbsp; The plan is to operate the pump with a 
		momentary on push button switch --- see electrical section for details. </p>
		<p class="style12">The pump has 3/8&quot; NPT input and output ports. There is 
		a 1/4&quot; NPT port on the end for a pressure switch.&nbsp; This pump 
		doesn't come with a pressure switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pump is 
		hidden in the electrical compartment under the oil tank.&nbsp; The photo 
		above shows the pump with some of the associated plumbing.&nbsp; The 
		1/8&quot; pipe across the bottom is the water input.&nbsp; The input pipe is 
		equipped with a coolant type quick connect on the right end. The hose 
		from the tender will connect there using a right angle female quick 
		connect fitting.&nbsp; These quick connects are identical to those used 
		on the oil filter.&nbsp; The water enters the pump via the  
		tee which has a male port in the middle that enters the pump 
		via a 3/8&quot; to 1/8&quot; bushing.&nbsp; The left side of the tee has a 1/4&quot; 
		tube compression fitting which connects to the pipe that carries the 
		input water to the axle pump.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hose clamp and 
		spacer serve to secure the pipe to the motor so that forces on the hose 
		from the tender won't be transferred to the plastic pump body. </p>
		<p class="style12">The normal 3/8&quot; output port at the top of the pump is 
		plugged and the output taken instead from the 1/4&quot; port out the end 
		normally used for a pressure switch.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two elbows are 1/4&quot; 
		with one port male and the other port female.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a 
		piston type check valve between the two elbows.(McMaster-Carr #7768K56).&nbsp; 
		A 1/4&quot; tube compression fitting is connected to the lower elbow. &nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style3">
		<img height="306" src="EP2.jpg" width="699" class="style11"></p>
		<p class="style3"><span class="style11">Photo above shows the input water pipe from the tender 
		hose fitting on the right to where it goes up between the two oil feed 
		lines just in front of the fuel valves.&nbsp; The pump sets between the 
		frame bar and the outer frame channel, both which have been modified 
		to accommodate the pump so that the top of the pump is no higher than the 
		top of the battery. </span> 
		<img height="255" src="EP3.jpg" width="699" class="style11"></p>
		<p class="style12">The photo above shows the pump output pipe--- it goes 
		through elbows and a union and follows the top of the frame toward the 
		front of the boiler. </p>

		constructed several years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; See 
		<a href="../ConAxelPump/AxelPumpCon.htm">Axel Pump Construction</a>. There is a ball bearing in 
		the aluminum rings on the right end.&nbsp; The pump is a Clippard 
		cylinder.&nbsp; The fittings between the elbows and the hose barbs 
		are check valves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

		<p class="style12">This shows the axel pump mounted on the front truck 
		--- although you can't see much of it.&nbsp; The eccentric and 
		surrounding bearing (now painted) are beside the gear case on the 
		far axel.&nbsp; The pump cylinder is under the bolster.&nbsp; The 
		blue hoses are from the pump, the lower one the input and the upper one 
		the output.&nbsp; (The black hose is for the brake cylinder.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The elbow and check valves are reversed from the position shown in the

		pipe. </p>

				connected to the boiler without any valve or check valve so they 
				are at boiler pressure.&nbsp; The axel pump forces the water 
				through the coils.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hope is that the water is&nbsp; 
				nearly boiler temperate when it enters the boiler.&nbsp; The 
				heating is done by the gases in the smoke box which contain 
				waste heat energy so this should improve efficiency ---more 
				steam! </td>
