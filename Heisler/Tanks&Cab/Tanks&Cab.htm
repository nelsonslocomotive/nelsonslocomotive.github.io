        The tanks on the Shay were made of galvanized steel 
		soft soldered together.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were several leaks that 
		were sealed with additional solder or, in the case of the water tank, 
		caulk.&nbsp;&nbsp; The inside of the water tank was finished with 
		waterproof paint and then truck bed&nbsp;liner spray coating.&nbsp; Much of the 
		bed liner coating has peeled off and at some point one or both 
		the tanks will probably rust and start to leak.&nbsp; The oil tank has a slight weep 
		but not enough to spend the effort to fix.</p>

        Wayne Godshall mentioned that he had made tenders with a steel outer 
		tank and an inner tank of PVC.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he used 1/4&quot; PVC 
		sheets, machined the edges very smooth and then glued the pieces 
		together.&nbsp; I tried the glue route and wasn't satisfied with the 
		results so ended up doing plastic welding on the joints.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		That worked very well once the process was figured out.&nbsp; 
		The water tank looks like it will hold for at least 20 years which at 
		my age is probably more than a lifetime.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't sure that 
		the PVC was compatible with the fuel oil and couldn't get a good yes 
		or no answer from any of my resources.&nbsp; A little test tank from 
		PVC scraps was tested with gasoline for several days with no noticeable 
		effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, also made the inner oil 
		tank of PVC.&nbsp; Later I learned that the best plastic for fuel is 
		polypropylene but the PVC should hold up for a while.&nbsp; If the PVC fails will make 
		a new tank with 
		polypropylene.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        The outer tanks were made of 18 gauge steel fastened 
		together with #0 drive screws and 1/16&quot; rivets (1/8&quot; head).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The tender tank must support the engineer's seat so it will be 
		reinforced and the top is 1/8&quot; thick (11 gauge).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style3">
        &nbsp;On the Shay, the tender fill port was near the front which required 
		that the seat be lifted away when water was added --- what a pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		This time I decided to fix the seat to the tender top via a bar stool 
		swivel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fill port was put toward the rear of the tender 
		behind the seat.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style3">
        The outer fuel tank and the cab will be one piece that is easily removed 
		to access the electrical components and the plumbing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		shay roof was hinged so that the back could be propped up to access the 
		controls.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a year or so the 
		roof was removed.&nbsp; The Heisler cab&nbsp; will have an open 
		roof.&nbsp; </p>
