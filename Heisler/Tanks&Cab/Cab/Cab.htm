        This is a more detailed drawing of the upper part of the cab front.&nbsp; 
		Two rivet spacing used on the cab is 0.7&quot; like on the the oil and 
		water tanks and 3/8&quot;. &nbsp; CFS 1/16&quot; stiffening strips 3/8&quot;, 1/2&quot; or 3/4&quot;

		side for the pipes over the walkways and the steam feed to the turret 
		as well as the throttle rod on the top of the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		opening around the boiler was cut as shown and then&nbsp; made larger as

        &nbsp; Architectural brass angles 1/16&quot; X 3 /4&quot; X 3/4&quot; (McMaster) were

		first riveted to the upper front and the sides were then attached to the 
		front via rivets.&nbsp;&nbsp; This joint was also soft soldered after 
		the riveting.</p>

        All the rivets on the cab are 1/16&quot; diameter (1/8&quot; head) X 1/4&quot; long

        The drawing above is of the right cab side; the left side is the mirror 
		image.&nbsp; The side is made as three pieces, the large forward piece, 
		the 3/4&quot; strip on the rear side of the door opening and the piece above 
		the door.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sides are 20 gauge HRS with 1/16&quot; CFS 
		stiffener strips behind the rows of rivets.&nbsp;&nbsp; A small section

		square. </p>
		<p class="style10">
        The rivets are 1/16&quot; diameter brass on 3/8&quot; or 0.7&quot; spacing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The parts for both sides were cut on the three-in-one sheet metal tool.&nbsp; 
		The pieces for the two sides were soft soldered together in a couple 
		places the then the hole for the window and the radius in the upper 
		corner piece cut in both sides at once.&nbsp; The rivet holes were

		tanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

		remainder of the stiffeners are all 1/16&quot; X 3/4&quot; CFS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style10">
        The small section of cab floor is a 1&quot; X 6&quot; piece of 16 gauge HRS plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		It is attached with pieces of 1/16&quot; X 3/4&quot; X 3/4&quot; brass angle with one 
		leg cut down to 9/16&quot;.&nbsp; The 9/16&quot; dimension is the size of the 
		square frame bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rear sill is attached to the under 
		side of the top frame bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom of outer oil tank sets 
		on that rear sill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom of the cab side is even 
		with the bottom of the outer oil tank.&nbsp; The cab floor sets on the 
		top side of the upper frame bar so the bottom of the cab floor is the 
		width of the frame bar (9/16&quot;) above the lower edge of the cab side.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The cab steps will attach to this little section of cab floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style10">
        The stiffeners are soft soldered in place after they are riveted.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The solder used was 3/32&quot; diameter Kester Aquabond silver bearing solder 
		----- I think it is 95% tin and 5% silver.&nbsp;&nbsp; This solder 
		seems to have&nbsp; poor filling properties but wicks into the joints 
		really well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruby liquid flux was used .&nbsp; The process 
		was to apply the flux, heat the joint with a small propane torch, touch 
		the end of the solder to the joint; if the joint is hot enough the 
		solder will melt and wick into the joint much like soldering copper 
		plumbing fixtures.&nbsp;&nbsp; The final step was to reheat the joint 
		and then bush on some of the liquid flux to smooth any bumps in the 
		solder.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the soldering is finished the piece is a 
		mess of burnt brush fibers and residue.&nbsp;&nbsp; A bath and then a 
		light bead blasting produces the finish shown in the photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <img height="527" src="TestFit.jpg" width="719"></p>

		fine.&nbsp; </p>

        <img height="498" src="TestFit1.JPG" width="719"></p>

				specified for 20 gauge and thinner stock.&nbsp; The curvature 
				for the middle part of the roof went fairly well.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				The photo shows the last of 4 or 5 rolls.&nbsp; The sharp bends 
				at the edges of the roof were made by positioning the metal 
				sheet at the point of those bends and then tightening the 
				rollers as far as they would go and then rolling an inch or so 
				in each direction.&nbsp;&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

        After the sharp corners were made on the roller the excess material was 
		cut off the edges.&nbsp; About 3/8&quot; of the roof edge was then clamped in 
		a large vise and the roof bent as necessary to achieve the exact shape 
		required for the edges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo above shows test 
		fitting the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was possible to get the roof shape such 
		that the gaps where the clamps are positioned was less than 1/4&quot; before 
		the clamps were tightened.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style10">
        The next step was to use a saber saw to cut the hole in the rear part of the roof ---- 9 
		3/8&quot; wide and 9&quot; front-to-back.&nbsp; A 1&quot; radius was used on the 
		corners.&nbsp; The edges were smoothed with files.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style10">
        The roof was then clamped in position and the joint between the roof and 
		cab front tack welded in a half dozen places on the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Rivets were then used to join the roof to the sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		roof side joint was then soft soldered.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style10">
        The prototype has a piece of angle along the roof-side joint to serve as 
		a gutter/drip edges.&nbsp; That was let off --- if it were made to scale 
		it would be flimsy and would likely cut the engineer's arm when he 
		adjusted some of the controls in the cab.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style10">
        The prototype had half round bead on both the front and rear roof edges 
		and on the lower and front edges of the large side windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		That didn't seem to add anything to the model.&nbsp;&nbsp; The half 
		round bead on the oil tank top edge was continued up the curved edge of 
		the side at the upper rear of the door and terminated at the roof joint. </p>
		<p class="style10">
        &nbsp;All the edges were rounded with files and a sanding drum in the 
		Dremel before the cab was painted. </p>

		The park brake can be accessed through the right side window.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The fuel controls are below the lip of the oil tank but easily accessed 
		by reaching down into the cab.&nbsp;&nbsp; The atomizer regulators are 
		not so easy to get to--- the lower one is best adjusted by reaching 
		through the left side door; fortunately these are typically adjusted 
		when firing up and then not messed with.&nbsp; The blower regulator is 
		to the left of the large gauge (boiler pressure).&nbsp; The throttle is 
		the long lever just to the right of the pressure gauge --- it is the 
		most used control and fairly easy to reach. </p>
