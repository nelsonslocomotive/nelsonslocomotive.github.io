        The oil tank is made very similar to the water tank; a steel outer tank 
		and a PVC inner tank.&nbsp; After making the inner tank of PVC it was 
		learned that polypropylene is the correct choice of material for oil 
		tanks so if or when the PVC tank fails it'll be replaced by a 
		polypropylene tank.&nbsp; Polypropylene sheets and welding rods are 
		available from McMaster-Carr.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style10">
        <img height="830" src="OilTankSide.jpg" width="700"></p>
		<p class="style10">
        The oil tank side is very similar to the side of the water tank except 
		only 9 1/2&quot; front-to-back.&nbsp; The front of the tank is inside of the 
		cab.&nbsp; The back edge of the cab side is riveted to the front of the 
		oil tank side.&nbsp; The last rivets are not shown on the side drawing above; 
		that detail will be covered on the Cab page.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style10">
        <img height="582" src="OilTankBack.jpg" width="700"></p>
		<p class="style10">
        The back of the oil tank is identical to the back of the water tank 
		except it is&nbsp; 1/4&quot; wider than the water tank.&nbsp; The back panel 
		is identical to the water tank front and back panels.</p>
		<p class="style10">
        <img height="578" src="OilTankFront.jpg" width="698"></p>
		<p class="style10">
        The oil tank front is identical to the back except that a hole is cut 
		for routing wiring in the middle and the bottom part is raised 9/16&quot; to 
		match the raised frame bars.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style10">
        The top of the oil tank was made of 16 gauge steel.&nbsp; Short 
		vertical reinforcing strips of 1/8&quot; X 1/2&quot; HRS&nbsp; were&nbsp; riveted 
		one to each side and two to the front and two to the back to help 
		support the top.&nbsp; The top is tack welded to these strips similar to 
		what was done on the outer water tank.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style10">
        The sheet metal was obtained cut to size from a local shop:</p>
		<p class="style10">
        Front and back: 9 1/2&quot; X&nbsp; 14 1/2&quot; 18 gauge </p>
		<p class="style10">
        Sides: 9 1/2&quot; X 12&quot; 18 gauge</p>
		<p class="style10">
        Top: 15 3/8&quot; X 12&quot; 16 gauge (had cut slightly oversize and the filed to 
		exact fit. </p>
		<p class="style10">
        <img height="534" src="Outertank1.jpg" width="700"></p>
		<p class="style10">
        This photo shows inside of the finished tank with those support strips.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The hole for the input port was cut with a hole 2&quot; hole saw as described 
		later. </p>
		<p class="style10">
        <img height="682" src="Outertank2.jpg" width="700"></p>
		<p class="style10">
        The outside of the tank with considerable surface rust.&nbsp; Note that 
		the bead has been applied to the back and part of the sides.&nbsp; The 
		bead will be finished after the cab sides are attached.</p>
		<p class="style10">
        <img height="443" src="PVCOilTank1.jpg" width="700"></p>
		<p class="style10">
        The inner PVC Oil Tank is shown above.&nbsp;&nbsp; The overall outside 
		dimensions are 5 3/4&quot; high 15&quot; wide and 8 7/8&quot; front-to-back.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The inside dimensions are 5 1/4&quot; X 14 1/2&quot; X 8 3/8&quot; giving a capacity of&nbsp; 
		about 2.7 gallons.&nbsp; The 1/4&quot; thick&nbsp; PVC sheets were cut to the following 
		dimensions:</p>
		<p class="style10">
        Top &amp; Bottom :&nbsp; 8 7/8&quot; X 15&quot;</p>
		<p class="style10">
        Sides: 8 3/8&quot; X&nbsp; 5 1/4&quot; </p>
		<p class="style10">
        Front &amp; Back: 5 1/4&quot; X 15&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style10">
        &nbsp;The the sides and bottom were plastic welded on both the inside and 
		outside just like the water tank.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point the top is 
		attached with four small sheet metal screws and a bead of caulk run 
		applied along the seam to give a temporary seal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is 
		to open the tank after a couple months and check for deterioration.&nbsp; 
		If everything is OK the top will be welded on.&nbsp; If there is a 
		problem at that time a replacement tank of polypropylene will be fabricated.</p>
		<p class="style10">
        The fill port is 1 1/2&quot; PVC pipe glued to a 2&quot; hole sawed in the top.&nbsp; 
		The PVC tank was placed inside the outer tank and the 2&quot; hole was&nbsp; 
		sawed through both tanks at the same time. A piece of coupling was&nbsp; 
		glued to the lower end of the fill pipe and the outside turned 
		to the exact diameter of the hole similar to what was done on the water 
		tank.</p>
		<p class="style10">
        <img height="560" src="PVCOilTank2.JPG" width="700">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This 
		photo shows the under side of the tank.&nbsp; The output port is a 3/4&quot; 
		PVC pipe to 1/2&quot; NPT female adapter.&nbsp; The hole through the tank was 
		made with a 1&quot; hole saw.&nbsp; A piece of PVC pipe was glued inside the 
		adapter to strengthen it and the&nbsp; end&nbsp; was then turned down to 
		the exact diameter of the hole for a length of 1/4&quot; matching the 
		thickness of the tank bottom.&nbsp; The adapter was glued into the 
		bottom and then welded.&nbsp; The output port is midway between the 
		frame 
		side and the outside frame channel.&nbsp; The fittings are a 1/2&quot; to 
		1/4&quot; bushing, 1/4&quot; nipple , 1/4&quot; angle valve and 1/4&quot; coolant type quick 
		connect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fitting just in front of the output port 
		is the bottom of a 3/8&quot; tube compression to 1/4&quot; NPT pipe fitting threaded 
		through a 1/4&quot; NPT hole tapped in the bottom of the tank.&nbsp; A piece 
		of 3/8&quot; copper tube in the upper compression end of the fittings serves 
		as a vent/over flow.&nbsp; The top of the tube is about 1/16' below the 
		bottom of the tank top. </p>
		<p class="style10">
        Shortly after the tank was finished it was knocked off the workbench.&nbsp; 
		The output port PVC fitting broke off just below the tank bottom.&nbsp; 
		The is a reminder that PVC is somewhat brittle.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fitting 
		was repaired by plastic welding --- worked really neat!</p>
		<p class="style10">
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <img height="538" src="PVCOilTank3.JPG" width="699"></p>
		<p class="style10">
        Photo above shows the finished PVC tank in position on top of the 
		battery.&nbsp; The tank is held in position by the steel outer tank.</p>
		<p class="style10">
        The 1/4&quot; thick PVC sheets were purchased with the intent of gluing them 
		together.&nbsp; A thinner sheet could be used since they are welded 
		rather than glued.&nbsp; I'll probably use 3/16&quot; thick sheets on the 
		next tank.</p>
		<p class="style11">
        <img height="632" src="OuterTank3.JPG" width="700"></p>
		<p class="style10">
        &nbsp;This photo shows the steel outer tank in position.&nbsp; Once the 
		cab side has been attached to the tank a fastener to hold the tank-cab 
		combination in place will be designed ----- probably a couple studs down 
		though the cab floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        Another view of the outer tank showing that vertical part of the 
		electrical compartment no longer sticks up like a sore thumb. </p>
