        The water tank is made of 1/4&quot; thick Type 1 PVC obtained in 24&quot; X 24&quot; 
		sheets from McMaster-Carr.&nbsp; &nbsp;The sheets were cut using a plywood 
		blade in a table saw.</p>
		<p class="style10">
        The tank overall dimensions are 21 1/4&quot; long, 14 3/4&quot; wide and 8 3/4&quot; 
		high.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dimensions of the six pieces are: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="style10">Top &amp; Bottom 14 3/4&quot; X 21 1/2&quot;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style10">Sides&nbsp; 8 1/4&quot; X 21 1/2&quot;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style10">Ends 8 1/4&quot; X 14 1/4&quot; </p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="style10">
        An additional piece the same size as the ends was cut and used as a 
		baffle in the middle of the tank. </p>
		<p class="style10">
        The finished tank inside dimensions are 21&quot;&nbsp; X 14 1/4&quot; X 8 1/4&quot; which 
		has a capacity of about 10.5 gallons.</p>
		<p class="style10">
        The first attempt at making the tank was to glue the sides and ends to 
		the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The results were unsatisfactory in that there 
		were several large leaks and the joints seemed weak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The joints were not of the strength one achieves gluing PCV pipe 
		fittings together.&nbsp;&nbsp; The major cause of the failure is 
		probably that the joints were not smooth and tight fitting.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The tank looked really good so went to Plan B and tried plastic welding.</p>

        &nbsp;The gun is connected to an air compressor for air and 115 volt AC 
		to power the heating element.&nbsp;&nbsp; The instructions say that air 
		should be turned on before the power is connected and left on after the 
		power is disconnected until the heating element cools.&nbsp; The gun 
		directs hot air onto the pieces to be welded much like an acetylene 
		torch.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two adjustments, the air pressure/volume 
		and the heat control.&nbsp;&nbsp; After some playing with the device I 
		set the air for very low pressure --- probably only a couple pounds and&nbsp; 
		and the heat control about mid scale.&nbsp; With these settings and the 
		tip held about 3/8&quot; from the rod the rod turns brown (singes) after 15 
		seconds or so. </p>

		<p class="style10">
        &nbsp;I ended up welding both the inside and outside of the tanks.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The weld on the inside are corner welds.&nbsp;&nbsp; What worked for me 
		is to lay the rod in the corner, start heating from one end and use the 
		bent tool made from a length of 1/8&quot; X 1/4&quot; CFS bar stock shown in the 
		photo to push the rod into the joint.&nbsp; Holding the pieces during 
		this operation is a challenge.&nbsp; The ~ 10&quot; length of large diameter 
		steel bar stock held the bottom in place and served as a vertical 
		surface to support the side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The top of the side will tend 
		to bend in much like welding steel.&nbsp; The operating is&nbsp; slower 
		then gas welding and it is possible to heat the pieces being welded to 
		the point where they begin to soften all the way through.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		When this happens I just stopped and let everything cool down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        After the outside of the tank was welded&nbsp; it was tested for leaks 
		again.&nbsp; There were several, mostly in the corners where three 
		pieces came together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tamping the outside welds must have 
		broken the inside welds. Reheating and tamping the outside fixed most 
		the leaks.&nbsp;&nbsp; In one corner the Dremel was used to cut out a 
		length of the outside weld and it was welded again.&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
		worked.&nbsp;</p>

        One of the attractive aspect of using plastic for the tanks is that
