        Drawing above shows how the tender tank sets on the fame.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The tank extends about halfway across the front and rear sills.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The rivet pattern is similar but not identical to the prototype; minor 
		changes were made to ease fabrication.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tank is 
		held to the frame with six 6-32 studs, three on each side.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The bead at the top is 3/32&quot; X 3/16&quot; half-round brass.</p>

		A width of 15.5&quot; matching the cab width would have been preferred.&nbsp; However, the tender frame was already constructed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

		<p align="left" class="style11">The top was cut from11 gauge steel --- 
		extra heavy to support the seat and engineer.&nbsp; The top was cut 
		slightly oversize and filed/ground to fit the assembled sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The top is tack welded to the sides on the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp; Four 
		holes are required for the seat swivel and one large hole is required 
		for the fill tube.&nbsp; These holes were positioned and drilled after 
		the tank was assembled.&nbsp; </p>

		The rivets are #0 drive screws.&nbsp; The holes for the drive screws are 
		0.067&quot; (#51 drill).&nbsp;&nbsp; A fixture was used to locate the rivet 
		holes. The fixture was held in position with #0 screws.&nbsp; Holes 
		where the screws were used were enlarged with a #50 drill so that the 
		screws would pass through.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two sides were stacked&nbsp; 
		and the holes drilled through both at the same time.&nbsp; Additional 
		holes are required along the top edge to attach the half round bead.&nbsp; 
		The bead was drilled first and then used as a template to drill the 
		sides.&nbsp; The bends on the dotted lines at each end were made after

		of the rivet holes in the ends.&nbsp; The holes in lower corners were 
		drilled first and screws through the holes held the two sides in 
		position.&nbsp; The clamps held the tops together.&nbsp; The drilling 
		fixture with10 holes is a piece of 1/2&quot; X 3/16&quot; CFS.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		holes in the fixture were spotted using the mill table indexing and digital readout.&nbsp; 
		The fixture is shown positioned for drilling the holes&nbsp;in the sides.&nbsp; 
		The fixture is held in place by the corner screw on the bottom.&nbsp; 
		Once positioned properly and clamped in place, a hole is drilled at the 
		other end and a screw inserted to hold the fixture for drilling the 
		remaining holes.&nbsp; Once a string of holes has been drilled, the last 
		hole drilled is used to position one end of the fixture for the setup of 
		the next set of holes.&nbsp; The holes along the top and bottom were drilled from each side and 
		the last holes in the middle adjusted as necessary to compensate for the 
		slight deviation.&nbsp; The most important thing with rivet detail is to 
		keep the rivets in a straight line and next most important is to make 
		the spacing as accurate as possible. &nbsp;</p>
