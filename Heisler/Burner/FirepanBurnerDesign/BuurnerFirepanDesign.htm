        <p align="left">
        <font face="Arial">The Shay uses a single burner.&nbsp; The Heisler is somewhat larger so 
        two burners will be provided.&nbsp; The two burners will share an atomizer 
        steam regulator and atomizer pressure gauge.&nbsp; There will be valves 
        between the regulator and the burners to permit each burner atomizer 
        feed to be shut off.&nbsp; Each burner will&nbsp; have a fuel valve.&nbsp; The 
        blower will also have a regulator and a pressure gauge.&nbsp; The blower 
        and atomizers will be arranged to connect to air for startup and then 
        switch to steam after pressure has built.&nbsp; The regulators have 
        given a little trouble on the Shay so they should be accessible for 
        maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fuel line to each burner will have a fuel 
        filter that is easily removed for cleaning/replacement. </font> </p>
        <p align="left">
        <font face="Arial">The prototype oil burner fire pan was usually lined with fire bricks 
        and/or a refractory material.&nbsp; I assume this was done to protect 
        the fire pan from damage from the intense heat.&nbsp; (The boiler 
        firebox is protected by the water jacket.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire pan has 
        no water jacket)&nbsp; The most recent fire pan on the Shay was 
        fabricated of 1/8&quot; channel and 1/8&quot; plate and it seems to be holding up 
        without a coating of refractory material so the plan for the Heisler is to use 
        channel, heavy plate and no messy refractory material. </font> </p>
        <p align="left">
        <font face="Arial">The fire pan should be easy to remove for maintenance.&nbsp; The drive 
        shaft between the engine and the middle truck runs under the fire pan 
        and  must be removed before the fire pan can be dropped.&nbsp; 
        The universal behind the engine can be disconnected by removing a 
        retaining ring and the associated pin.&nbsp; Once that end is 
        disconnected, the rear end of the shaft will slide out of the slip 
        joint.&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left">
        <font face="Arial">The fire pan will be attached to the bottom of the boiler with four 
        10-32 screws, two on each side.&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left">
        <font face="Arial">The fire pan should be removable as a unit with the burner nozzles, the 
        baffle, the rear support for the super heater tubes and the igniter 
        sparkplug.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fuel lines and atomizer steam lines should be 
        equipped with standard compression fittings for easy disconnection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

        <p align="left">
        <font face="Arial">The fire pan on the Shay uses 2&quot; channels for the 
        sides and 1/8&quot; plate for the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The drive shaft&nbsp; under the middle of the 
        Heisler fire pan limits the pan height 
        to a little less than 1.5&quot;.&nbsp; The drawing above shows the fire pan 
        which is constructed from 1.25&quot; X 1/8&quot; channels for the sides and 1/8&quot; 
        plate for the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The part numbers link this 
        drawing to individual part drawings further down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
        <p align="left">
        <font face="Arial">The bottom is attached to the channels with 6-32 
        screws.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once everything is assembled and known to fit, the 
        inside corners of the channel will be welded.</font></p>
        <p align="left">
        <font face="Arial">The atomizer steam line was run through the fire pan 
        on the latest shay modifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; There isn't enough room 
        between the&nbsp; burner units and the side of the fire pan to do that 
        here and still have an easy way to use standard compression fittings to 
        disconnect the atomizer pipe to remove the burner for maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        (The burners might need to be cleaned so it is a requirement that each 
        burner be easily removed without removing the fire pan.)&nbsp; The plan 
        is to run the atomizer steam line and fuel line for each burner down the 
        side of the fire pan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be no fittings next 
        to the burners.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lines&nbsp; will be fitted with 
        compression fittings just beyond the rear of the fire pan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        There will be brackets for the lines along the side of the fire pan.&nbsp; 
        The bracket will hold the steam line against the side of the fire pan 
        for heating of the steam and hold the fuel line about 1/4&quot; away from the 
        side of the fire pan to provide some heating but not too much.&nbsp; 
        Each tube bracket will be secured with one screw and the burner bracket 
        (HM654) is secured with two screws so the burner can be removed by 
        taking out four screws and disconnecting two compression fittings.

        <font face="Arial">The drawing above shows the fire pan and burners (blue) in relation to 
        the frame, engine, middle shaft and universals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that 
        there is a slight interference with the universal under the front of the 
        fire pan.&nbsp;&nbsp; The front channel and bottom plate will be notched 
        back 3/8&quot; in the middle to provide clearance.&nbsp; There appears be be 
        ample clearance for the rear universal.&nbsp; However, that universal 
        will move up and down some as the truck flexes so the rear channel might 
        also require a small notch.&nbsp;&nbsp; There appears to be some 
        interference between the burner and the universal on the drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        However, the burners are toward the sides of the fire pan and the 
        universal is under the middle of the fire pan so there is ample 
        clearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>

        for the igniter spark plug.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adjacent smaller tapped 6-32 hole is for a screw through the HM659 igniter plug 
        retaining plate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional holes in the front channel are 
        required to hold the baffle described later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>

        is attached to the fire pan and the baffle with short pieces of 1&quot; X 1&quot; X

        the flues.&nbsp;&nbsp; The baffle support and support angles are
