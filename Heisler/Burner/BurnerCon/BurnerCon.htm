        The oil fire involves the oil supply, steam or air supply for the 
		atomizer function and steam or air supply for the blower.&nbsp; On the 
		shay, once a good setting is found for the oil valve and atomizer 
		pressure little adjustment is required (the atomizer feed is equipped 
		with a regulator).&nbsp; However, the blower valve requires frequent 
		adjustment to compensate for changes in boiler pressure.&nbsp; A blower 
		pressure regulator has been included on the Heisler to (hopefully) 
		reduce the need to monitor the blower pressure closely.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style2">
        <img height="622" src="BurnerPlumbing.jpg" width="697"></p>
		<p align="left" class="style2">
        &nbsp;The diagram above shows the layout of the burner and associated 
		plumbing.&nbsp; The oil feed is in the lower part of the drawing with the pipes in 
		black.&nbsp; The steam- air system is in the upper part of the diagram 
		with the pipes in red.&nbsp; During startup the valve to the steam 
		manifold is closed and an air line is connected to the air input 
		quick-connect fitting and the associated valve opened.&nbsp; Once boiler 
		pressure has built to about 40 psi the valve to the steam manifold is 
		opened and the external air valve is closed.&nbsp; The check valve in 
		the external air feed is to prevent steam from entering the air line and 
		air compressor should I forget to shut off the valve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style2">
        <strong>Update 8/6/2010: </strong>&nbsp;The first few tests of the 
		burner revealed that the atomizer steam didn't seem to be equally 
		divided between the two burners.&nbsp; This may be because the burner 
		nozzles weren't identical.&nbsp;&nbsp; The burner system was redesigned 
		to use two regulators and two heaters.&nbsp; Rather than 
		completely redoing this page photos showing the new design were added 
		to the end of the page.&nbsp;</p>

        This shows how the fuel plumbing fits on the frame.&nbsp; The oil line 
		is in the right rear corner of the tank with a right angle shutoff valve 
		on the end.&nbsp; The quick-connect to the rear of the filter connects 
		to the shutoff valve.&nbsp; The oil tank must be easily removed to gain 
		access the electrical compartment below the tank.&nbsp; The shutoff 
		valve and quick connects make it easy to disconnect the fuel line.&nbsp; 
		The line passes right to left via the 1/8&quot; brass pipe which will be just 
		in front of the electrical switch panel. The current plan is to make a 
		hump in the rear of the floor plate to cover the pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        <strong>Update 3/27/10:&nbsp; </strong>After the electrical compartment 
		was constructed the location of the fuel line above the cab floor stuck 
		out like a sore thumb.&nbsp; It also became apparent that the fuel line 
		would be prevent the use of operating cab doors.&nbsp; The fuel line was 
		routed above the cab floor to permit the fuel line with valves to be 
		lifted out as a complete unit.&nbsp; After rethinking this I decided to 
		hang the fuel line below the frame sides.&nbsp; The new configuration is 
		shown above ---- note that the left side frame channel is off giving a 
		better view of the fuel valves.&nbsp; The fuel line can be unscrewed 
		from the elbow behind the valves when it is necessary to remove the 
		valves.&nbsp; The fuel line quick connect fitting is lower in this 
		configuration so the mating angle quick connect on the forward end of 
		the fuel filter will be replaced by a straight quick connect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The cab floor can now be a simple flat plate. <strong>End update.</strong> </p>

        An abundance of testosterone requires that one of the regulators be 
		disassembled to see how it works.&nbsp; A more important reason is that 
		the hi temperature version of these with the Viton seals requires an 
		order of at least 10 so I decided to purchase the low temperature 
		version and change the O-Ring seal myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left" class="style2">
        Disassembly is straight forward once one can get the plug on the right 
		end off.&nbsp; That blue stuff on the threads is a sealer that works really well.&nbsp; 
		I grasped the body in the lathe 3-jaw chick and attacked the thin edge 
		of the pug with channel locks.&nbsp; The channel locks left their mark 
		but I was able to get it apart.</p>
		<p align="left" class="style2">
        The main valve is in the plug on the left side.&nbsp; The valve is opened 
		by pushing the needle thing to the left.&nbsp;&nbsp; When assembled, the 
		needle fits into the hollow rod of the piston which forms a relief 
		valve.&nbsp; The space between the piston and the main valve is at the 
		same pressure as the output (which is via the half of the 3/16' union 
		screwed into the side of the cylinder).&nbsp;&nbsp; The piston balances 
		the output pressure against the main spring (the heavy one which is 
		controlled by the adjustment screw on the far right.)&nbsp; If the 
		output pressure is too low, the spring will force the piston to the left 
		which will in turn push the input valve open.&nbsp; Pressure will build 
		until the pressure below the piston matches the spring force above the 
		piston and the input valve is open just enough to allow the inflow to 
		match the outflow.&nbsp; If for some reason the output pressure gets too 
		high (such as when the pressure setting is reduced and there is very 
		little flow) the piston will move to the right far enough to open the 
		relief valve and allow the excess gas to escape through the hollow 
		piston rod and out though a hole near in the right end of the 
		cylinder.</p>
		<p align="left" class="style2">
        There appears to be a thin rubber seal on that relief valve and I suspect 
		there is also a similar seal on the main input valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
		can't replace those seals but suspect that the valves will still work 
		even if those seals are destroyed ---- they'll be metal on metal valves 
		which might have small leaks which won't be a problem with this 
		relatively high flow application.&nbsp; The big O-Ring could cause a big 
		leak if it was destroyed so I replaced it with a #013 Viton O-Ring. </p>
		<p align="left" class="style2">
        I noticed that the O-ring had been greased.&nbsp; That grease will 
		probably be wiped out by the steam flow so it will be necessary to 
		lubricate these regulators periodically ---- a couple drops of steam oil 
		into the left side of the steam manifold via one of the plugs in the 
		top should work. </p>
		<p align="left" class="style2">
        One last point --- the regulators can be ordered with different pressure 
		ranges.&nbsp; I suspect that the only thing different for the different 
		pressure ranges is one or both of the larger springs. </p>

		head cap screws are removed to allow the fire pan to drop.&nbsp; The 
		baffle plate sticks up about 8&quot; so the engine must be on a rack or stand 
		that is open between the rails so that the fire pan can drop down below
