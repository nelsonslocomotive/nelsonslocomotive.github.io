        <p class="style1"><font face="Arial"><span class="style2">The burner 
		system has 
		been operated for about ten hours and exceeds expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The use of dual burners was new and a bit of experimentation was 
		required to find a suitable operating process.</span></font></p>
		<p class="style6">The best way to start up seems to be to light only one burner.&nbsp; 
		A propane torch flame 
		through the hole around one of the burners is one way to light the fire.&nbsp; 
		The&nbsp; 
		one burner runs very similar to the single burner in the Shay:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="style6">If too little fuel is supplied, the fire will go 
			out.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style6">If too much fuel is supplied, the fire will smoke 
			(and the flues will collect soot).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style6">The correct amount of fuel will give a stable 
			flame and very little smoke.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style6">The correct fuel point is fairly narrow --- like 
			about 10% </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style4"><span class="style3">The correct fuel level is 
			correlated with the draft (blower or exhaust); more draft, more 
			fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><font face="Arial">
			<span class="style7">&nbsp; </span></font></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="style6">Once one burner is operating, the 
		second burner can be turned on.&nbsp; The second burner has an 
		identical proper operating fuel level.&nbsp; Too much fuel will cause 
		the burner to smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the second burner can be 
		turned down to any level --- the other burner that is stable will keep 
		relighting the second burner if it goes out.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style6">The two burners permit an adjustment from maybe 40% of 
		maximum output with one burner to the maximum with the two burners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style6">When pulling a heavy load the fire will be less stable 
		because of the added draft.&nbsp;&nbsp; Increasing the fuel slightly 
		stabilizes the fire.&nbsp; The fire can also be stabilized by opening 
		the damper in the firebox door. </p>
		<p class="style6">I've had several discussions with Randy Sutherland who 
		has run an oil burning Mikado&nbsp; for many years.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
		operation matches his view that each burner has a maximum output before 
		it will smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire box volume will also limit the 
		amount of fuel that can be consumed effectively.&nbsp; Apparently the 
		Heisler firebox is big enough for two burners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this 
		point it's unknown whether the maximum is two or if three or four burners could be 
		used.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style6">I was skeptical as to the value of the refractory 
		cement inside the fire pan.&nbsp;However, I now think it is a good idea.&nbsp; 
		Any fuel that is not combusted drops onto the cement where it seems to 
		evaporate and then combust rather than leak out as it does on the Shay 
		which doesn't use the cement coating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style6">The two burners appear to provide sufficient steam 
		even on the steep grades of Mill Creek Central Railroad.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
		the first few runs the second burner was turned on only when going up a 
		grade; the single burner provides adequate steam on the flat stretches.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		More experience pulling a string of cars or a half dozen riders is 
		required to provide a complete evaluation. 
		I'll come back and update this page after some operation with greater 
		loads.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
