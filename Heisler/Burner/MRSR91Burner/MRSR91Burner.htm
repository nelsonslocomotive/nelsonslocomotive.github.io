      <p>Most locomotives in the eastern US were coal fired.&nbsp; In the northwest US oil firing was very common if not prevalent.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Being from the Midwest, I'd never seen an oil fired locomotive before
      going to Mt Rainier Scenic Railroad.&nbsp; In
      fact, I don't recall seeing any photos or drawings of the full size
      oil burners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It turns out that the burner on MRSR 91 has
      many similarities with the oil burner on my Shay model,&nbsp; ---- a design copied from
      Bob Reedy's Climax.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The MRSR 91 burner is described below.&nbsp; I didn't bother taking a bunch of
      measurements.&nbsp; However, one should be able to estimate the dimensions
      based on the known size of nearby parts.</p>

              The bottom of the fire pan is just above the top of the drive
              shaft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire pan slides up inside the
              firebox.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ash pans which hang down on each side of
              the drive shaft of a coal burner have been eliminated.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              A couple stiffening angles run the length of the pan on each side
              of the drive shaft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>The burner nozzle is directly above the universal.&nbsp; The
              louvers control the burner air supply.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The brown extension cord was being used for work lights and had
              nothing to do with the burner.</td>

              grates of the coal burner I was curious as to the inside of of an
              oil burner firebox.&nbsp; This is the view from the firebox
              door.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are probably firebricks lining the fire
              pan sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; The horizontal slit in the burner nozzle is
              clearly visible.&nbsp; That is a plastic soft drink bottle near
              the front.&nbsp; I don't know whether it was placed there to
              help in the starting process or if the Heisler doubles as an incinerator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              provide the air passage from near the floor up and into the
              firebox.&nbsp; The lever on the side probably controls louvers to
              regulate the draft.&nbsp;</td>

              controls the outer shaft that links to the draft louvers at the

              that controls atomizing compressed air (during startup) or steam
              to the burner nozzle.&nbsp; The knob just in front of the upper

              which is reassuring.
              <p>The oil feed is via the bottom of the nozzle and the air/steam
              enters the forward side of the nozzle via the smaller pipe.&nbsp;

              scenic ride later in the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>I can make the oil burner on my shay smoke without
              difficulty.&nbsp; However, I always associated smoke with soot in
