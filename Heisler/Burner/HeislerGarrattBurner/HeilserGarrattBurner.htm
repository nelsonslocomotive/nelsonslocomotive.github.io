            this chute is an air input vent.&nbsp;&nbsp; The piece inside the 
            vent is probably a damper.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my understanding that 
            early oil burners has these side vents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later designs 
            had vents in the firebox door in place of these side vents.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

            floor, through the door and into the firebox.&nbsp;&nbsp; I assume 
            this elaborate arrangement is used rather than just opening the door

      <p><font face="Arial">The Heisler and Garratt have similar size openings around the burner 
      nozzle for combustion air. (See <a href="../MRSR91Burner/MRSR91Burner.htm">
      MRsR91 Burner</a> for photos of that burner).&nbsp;&nbsp; The Heislers 
      have a damper on the combustion air and the Garratts don't.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspect that the damper 
      permits a greater range of oil feed to the burner. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The later Heisler and the late Garratts have vents in the fire box door 
      with a damper to control the vent opening.&nbsp; The early Heisler appears 
      to have vents with adjustable dampers at the rear of the fire pan. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial">I tried some vents at the rear of the fire pan on the Shay with little 
      effect (see
      <a target="_top" href="../../../Shay/Operation/MorePower/MorePower.htm">
      More Power</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; I now suspect that on the prototype the rear vents are used to 
      reduce excessive draft which might blow out the fire.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
      could happen when the exhaust is creating a lot of draft--- possibly when 
      under a very heavy load.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I'll make a door with a 
      vent and damper for the Heisler and try opening it when the locomotive is 
      under heavy load.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
