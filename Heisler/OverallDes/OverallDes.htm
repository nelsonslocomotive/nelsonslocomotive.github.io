      <p align="left">Many times when building the Shay I wished I had know about 
      and understood some of the features and options I had to squeeze in later.&nbsp; 
      Hopefully I'll do some planning this time and things should work out 
      better.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is a list&nbsp;in random order of&nbsp; items of concern&nbsp; and data relating to the items.</p>


      <p align="left"><b>Water Tank: </b>The Shay water tank at ~ 7.5 gal could 
      be larger.&nbsp; The Heisler is 50% larger so we want at least 50% more 
      capacity or at least 11.25 gal. The 13 gal tank in drawing above is about as large as we 
      can make without deviating from the Heisler profile.&nbsp;&nbsp; There 
      is no plan for a hand pump in the tender so the design will be a little 
      simpler, just one low pressure feed pipe from the tender to the 
      locomotive.&nbsp;&nbsp; A quick connect hose fitting like that used on the 
      Shay will probably be used.&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Axel Pump-Feed Water Heater: </b>The plan is to use an 
      axel pump to supply feed water via a feed water heater.&nbsp; The pump 
      will be mounted on the front truck and feed up through the saddle to the 
      heater located in the top of the smoke box.&nbsp; The heater output will 
      feed a check valve on the right side of the boiler.&nbsp; There will be be 
      an output bypass with valve to regulate the amount of water fed to 
      the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; The valve is a fireman's control and thus will be 
      located on the left side of the cab. </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Injector: </b>The locomotive will be equipped with a 
      feed water injector.&nbsp; The injector will be located on the left side 
      of the locomotive.&nbsp; The prototype had the injector in the cab against 
      the left side of the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is one possibility for the 
      model.&nbsp; Another possibility is below the cab floor on the left side.&nbsp; 
      The steam and water control valves will both be on the left side of the 
      cab.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Fuel:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The locomotive will be fueled with oil as is 
        MRSR 91.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Burner:</b>&nbsp; The burner design will be similar to 
      that used on the shay.&nbsp;&nbsp; A regulator will be used on the 
      atomizer feed like was done on the shay.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the shay it was 
      found that the blower needed frequent adjustment as the boiler pressure 
      fluctuated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to make these adjustments is probably the 
      major cause of soot buildup in the tubes&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to try a 
      blower regulator on the Heisler to see if that helps.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      atomizer and blower controls as well as the fuel control will be on the 
      left side of the cab.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is to try some different nozzle 
      configurations in test setups to see if a better way can be found to mix 
      the air with the fuel and minimize wasted input air.&nbsp; The final 
      design may or may not include a adjustable air damper.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also 
      want to try heating the atomizer and fuel feed pipes by running them 
      inside the fire pan on the way to the nozzle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Spark Plug:</b>&nbsp; The burner will be equipped with a spark 
        plug to relight the burner.&nbsp; The same design electronic circuit and 
        6 volt motorcycle coil used in the used in the Shay will be used here.&nbsp; 
        The coil is 5.5&quot; long and the largest diameter (a ridge on one end) is 
        1.875&quot;.&nbsp; The coil with electronic circuit will fit in the 
      space between the fuel tank bottom and the top of the middle truck frame 
      bolster.</p>


      <p align="left"><b>Lights: </b>I'll probably use the same 12 volt - 20 watt 
        halogen bulbs Dick McCloy has been using on his locomotives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Dick connects them directly to 12 volt for the bright setting connects 
        two lamps in series for dim setting.&nbsp; The dim setting is still very 
        bright so running at 9 or 10 volts is probably more then adequate and a 
        dimmer circuit is probably required.&nbsp; Instrument lighting is also 
      required for the water glass and steam pressure gauge.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Battery:</b> I didn't plan ahead for a battery on the 
      shay so my options were limited when I finally figured out I needed 
      electrical power. I ended up using a set of four D Cells on the shay. LEDs 
      were used in the headlamps to keep the power drain low. This time I want 
      to brute force the electrical supply so have decided on a 12 volt lead 
      acid battery.&nbsp; A battery capacity of 10 to 20 Amp Hours would be 
      useful if I run a lot at night.&nbsp; I found a 12 V, 17 AH sealed lead 
      acid battery&nbsp; that can be used upright or on it's side.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The battery dimensions are 7.13&quot; X 2.99&quot; X 6.54&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom of 
      the fuel tank will be 3.25&quot; above the bolster to allow room for one of 
      these batteries above the bolster between the frame sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      There is also room for the electronic circuit and coil to one side of the 
      battery.&nbsp;&nbsp; A solid state regulator will be required to reduce 
      the 12 volts to the maximum 6 volts permitted on the electronic circuit 
      and coil.&nbsp; There is also room in this area for a light dimmer 
      regulator.&nbsp; The electrical circuit will be equipped with a voltmeter 
      to indicate charge.</p>


      <p align="left"><b>Electrical Switches: </b>The electrical switches for 
      lights will be located under the cab on whichever side has room.&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Battery Charger:&nbsp; </b>The battery charger will 
      either be external or located under the fuel tank if there is room.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      A jack for either charger input if the charger is mounted on the 
      locomotive or&nbsp; charger output if the charger is external&nbsp; will be 
      mounted somewhere on the underside of the cab. </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Oil Tank:</b> The Shay oil tank is ~ 2.25 gal and 
      adequate ---- the water tanker must be filled several times for each tank 
      of fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Heisler&nbsp; fuel tank&nbsp; shown in the 
      drawing above will be ~ 3.4 gal which 
      is 50% bigger than the shay tank and also adequate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
      would be nice to have an easy way to tell the level of the fuel tank.&nbsp; 
      The prototype had a fairly large opening to fill the tank.&nbsp; If that 
      type of an opening is used it may be possible to judge the fuel level 
      through the opening.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tank will need to be removed easily 
      to access the equipment underneath.&nbsp; The shay used only two screws to 
      hold down the fuel tank, accessed from underneath near the outer edge.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      That should be adequate for the Heisler too.&nbsp; An additional 2 to 4 
      small screws may be needed to secure the top rear of the cab side to the 
      tank.&nbsp; It may be possible to have some sort of a sliding fastener in 
      that area and avoid the need for the screws.&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Fuel Filter: </b>The fuel line to the nozzle will 
      require a filter.&nbsp; The rather course one used on the shay is probably 
      the best choice.&nbsp; The filter is located under the cab floor on the 
      shay and rather difficult to get at.&nbsp; A better solution for the 
      Heisler might be to locate it between the frame side and the frame side 
      channel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the filter should be easily removed for 
      cleaning ----- maybe a sort of quick connect similar to that used on the 
      shay water lines might work.</p>


      <p align="left"><b>Fuel Valve: </b>The fuel valve on the shay is an 
      inexpensive needle valve located in the inside bottom of the tank and 
      controlled by a shaft running up through the tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
      the Heisler I prefer a better quality needle valve possibly located below 
      the cab floor between the tank and the the back of the boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      One possibility is to have a fuel shutoff valve below the tank and 
      fastened to the tank bottom.&nbsp; The output from the valve could feed 
      the filter through a quick connect and then on to the control valve via 
      another quick connect.&nbsp; One of the filter quick connects could be 
      opened to provide a path to drain the tank if necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      quick connect would also make it easier to remove the tank if necessary to 
      access the stuff under the tank.&nbsp; </p>


        <p><b>Compressed Air: </b>A small manifold will be provided to supply 
        air or steam to the atomizer and blower regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
        standard air quick connect will be provided on the left 
        side under the cab floor with check valve and shutoff valve to supply 
        air to this manifold during startup.&nbsp;&nbsp; There will also be a 
        steam line from the turret (with valve) to the manifold to take over  
        from the air supply once steam pressure has built.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The steam valve will be closed during startup to keep air out of the 
        boiler.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Foot Pegs:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> Folding<b> </b>motorcycle type fool pegs 
        will be attached to the frame&nbsp; side channels near the cab doors.</p>
        <p><b>Whistle:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The locomotive will be equipped with a 
        steam whistle similar to the one described in <u>SO YOU WANT TO BUILD A 
        LIVE STEAM LOCOMOTIVE</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp; That whistle is 1.5&quot; diameter and 
        12&quot; long.&nbsp;&nbsp; The whistle will be mounted under the fuel 
        tank or cab floor between the frame side and the frame side channel&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Experience with the shay is that after adjusted initially, the whistle 
        requires no maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The channel is also 1.5&quot; high so 
        the whistle can be mounted on the inside of the channel U where it will 
        be completely hidden.&nbsp;&nbsp; The whistle valve will be located on 
        the right&nbsp; side of the cab.</p>
        <p><b>Air Brakes:&nbsp; </b>The locomotive will be equipped with a two 
        stage steam powered air compressor mounted above the right side of the front truck.&nbsp; 
        There will be one or two air storage tanks under the boiler behind the 
        saddle.&nbsp; There will be a regulator in the air line feeding the 
        brake valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brake valve will be located on the right 
        side of the cab.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single acting brake cylinders with 
        spring return will be used the front and tender trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The middle truck might be too crowded for the brake hardware.&nbsp; The 
        tender&nbsp; truck will be equipped with a park brake.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Cab Roof: </b>The shay roof was arranged to be raised when 
        operating and lowered for show.&nbsp;&nbsp; That arrangement worked OK but 
        in many cases I just removed it to make operation easier.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        center of&nbsp; the Heisler roof will be open from the back most of the way to the 
        front and be permanently attached.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Remote Controls: </b>The most frequent used controls on the Shay 
        are the throttle and the blower.&nbsp; Hopefully, the planned blower 
        regulator will eliminate the need for that constant adjustment.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The engineer must bend over to reach the throttle on the shay which can 
        lead to a sore back.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bending over and reaching for the 
        throttle also causes the engineer to take his eye off the track ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The plan for the Heisler is to mechanically link the throttle, reverse 
        and brake controls to levers on top the fuel tank behind the cab roof.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        These levers should be high enough so that the engineer can make 
        adjustments without bending over.&nbsp;&nbsp; The remotes&nbsp; should 
        be made easily removed to restore the aesthetics.&nbsp; Maybe a remote 
        for the whistle valve would also be nice.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Steam Turret: </b>The steam turret will be fed from the steam dome 
        with a pipe that runs along the top of the boiler into the cab.&nbsp; 
        There will be a ball valve is this pipe to isolate the turret from the 
        boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; The turret will be a square horizontal&nbsp; brass 
        bar the runs cross ways on top the boiler near the back.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Angle control valves will screw into the cab side of the turret.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The following control valves will be required:&nbsp; </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Steam supply to atomizer and blower regulators.</li>
          <li>Steam supply to air compressor.</li>
          <li>Steam supply to whistle valve.</li>
          <li>Steam supply to injector.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The injector might use a handle type valve like the type made by LSM 
        rather than the angle valve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>More to come later.</p>
