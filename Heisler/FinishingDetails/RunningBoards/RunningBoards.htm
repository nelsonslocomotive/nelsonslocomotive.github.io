        The Heisler running boards run from the front of the cab to the front of 
		the boiler.&nbsp; They rest on the upper frame bar.&nbsp; The crew can 
		access the running boards from doors in the front of the cab or via 
		stairs from the front sill.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        The photos above shows the front of the running boards and the stairs on 
		MRSR91.&nbsp; The stringers on both sets of stairs look like they have 
		been mangled at some point.&nbsp; The next two photos show the running 
		boards and stairs on Cass No 6.&nbsp; The major difference between the 
		running boards for the two locomotives is where the steam supply pipes 
		go through the running boards. </p>

        The drawing above shows the left running board.&nbsp; The required 
		dimensions will likely vary from locomotive to locomotive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The 1&quot; hole is for the&nbsp; steam supply pipe.&nbsp; The plate is sawed 
		in two at the hole.&nbsp; A joining plate is attached under the saw cut 
		to facilitate joining the two pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp; The inside edge is cut 
		pack to give clearance for the water supply valve and check valve that 
		is at the same elevation as the walkway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right 
		side is identical except for cut outs around the compressor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        The two photos above show the installed left side running board.&nbsp; 
		The first photo was taken when the locomotive was nice and clean show how the 
		rear of the running board is attached to the lower part of the cab front 
		using a small angle.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second photo was taken after the 
		locomotive was operated for about 20 hours and not thoroughly cleaned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The steps (described later) are attached to the running board at the top 
		and rest on the front sill on the outside and the frame tray on the 
		inside. </p>

        <img height="329" src="RunningBoards5.jpg" width="450">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style10">
        The running board rests on the top of the frame.&nbsp; The outside of 
		the running board is supported by the angle bracket at the back and the 
		aluminum block shown in photo above.&nbsp; The block is a piece of 1/2&quot; 
		square bar stock with the end cut at a 45 degree angle.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		block is attached to the cylinder (the area with no steam passages below) 
		with a couple 6-32 SHCS.&nbsp; The angled surface is at the same 
		elevation as the top of the frame.&nbsp; A hole is drilled into the 
		angled surface and tapped for a 4-40 screw to secure the running board. </p>

        <img height="493" src="RunningBoards6.jpg" width="800"></p>
		<p class="style10">
        &nbsp;An angle bracket was located just forward of the end of the boiler 
		jacket.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bracket was made of a ~1/16&quot; thick angle 
		attached to a scrap piece of the smoke box tube.&nbsp; The bracket was 
		attached to the running board with a couple 4-40 screws and the hole 
		through the curved part used to mark the location of a threaded 6-32 hole 
		through the smoke box.&nbsp;&nbsp; This bracket is not used on the right side.&nbsp; Instead, 
		right running board is attached to 
		the mounting for the air compressor.&nbsp; </p>

		<p class="style10">
        &nbsp;The drawing above shows the construction of the stairs.&nbsp; 
		All the pieces are cut and formed from 1/16&quot; X 3/4&quot; CFS strips purchased 
		form McMaster.&nbsp; The treads are attached to&nbsp;the stringers with 
		2-56 hex head screws.&nbsp;&nbsp; The stringers were cut extra long on 
		the bottom and then trimmed to fit after the assembled staircase was 
		clamped to the running board for a test fit.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <img height="262" src="StairParts.jpg" width="600"></p>
		<p class="style10">
        This last photo shows the parts for the stairs.&nbsp; The bends on th 
		ends of the treads were 
		made by grasping the tread in a vise and pounding the edge over with a 
		hammer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
