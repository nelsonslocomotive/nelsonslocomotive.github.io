        T<span class="style15">his past Fall Russ Kepler brought his beautiful Shay pictured above all 
		the way from Albuquerque to the Logging Locomotive Meet at Mill Creek 
		Central.&nbsp; I was immediately envious of the number plate --- what a 
		finishing touch!&nbsp; Russ said he purchased the number plate as well 
		as builder's plates which he hadn't installed yet from Robert Dustin.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I recalled that I got a catalogue from Dustin about ten years earlier so 
		after the meet I got the catalogue out.&nbsp; That catalogue was for 
		1:20 scale (garden railroads) but the data indicated that he could make 
		any scale.&nbsp;&nbsp; I emailed Dustin to get prices for 1.5&quot; scale.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		He quickly returned the prices as $45 for a number plate and $52 for a 
		pair of builders plates, including taxes and shipping.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
		sent him a check and got the plates about 6 weeks later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<td class="style12">The plates are about 1/16&quot; thick.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a 
				fixture for the number plate consisting of a 1/8&quot; thick disk 
				slightly smaller than the number plate diameter and silver 
				soldered the disk to a 10/32 threaded rod.&nbsp; A clearance 
				hole was drilled most the way through the smoke box door with 
				the last 1/8&quot; or so threaded 10/32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number 
				plate was attached to the disk with hi temperature epoxy.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				The fixture/number plate were then screwed into the door, aligned 
				properly and secured in position&nbsp; with a 10-32 nut. Photo 
				at the right shows the edge of the number plate and fixture.

        Once the the builder's plates arrived I did some research to determine 
		where to mount them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I checked my hundreds of photos 
		of MRSR91 and couldn't any that showed the builder's plate or holes in 
		the typical locations where the plate was attached. (Yes, I have photos 
		that show that detail.)&nbsp; My guess is that the MRSR91 plates were 
		stolen or removed to prevent theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        A typical location for the builder's plate was on the frame above the

        &nbsp;The builders plate on Cass Heisler No 6 is attached to the frame 
		gusset above the rear axel of the front truck as shown above.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I found a couple other photos of builders plates on late Heislers 
		attached to this gusset so I located mine there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
