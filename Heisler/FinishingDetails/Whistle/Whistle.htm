		<p class="style19">The Heisler has been in operation for several years 
		with no whistle ---- just no fun.&nbsp; On the prototype, the whistle is 
		a warning signal like a auto horn and is also often useful&nbsp;for the 
		same purpose on model tracks.&nbsp; It can also be used as a form 
		of greeting -- like tooting your horn at a friend.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Several 
		years ago I took a ride on the Nevada Northern Railroad.&nbsp; The train 
		stopped at the edge of town and the engineer blew the whistle for a 
		while until some woman came out on a porch and waved.&nbsp; I later 
		learned that the house was a brothel (legal in Nevada) and greeting the 
		girls from the train is historic from the mining days.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="style19">
        The whistle on the Shay (<a href="../../../Shay/MorePlumbing/PlumbingXWhistle/PlumbingX.htm">Shay 
		Whistle</a>) was a success so I decided to duplicate it.&nbsp; The Shay 
		whistle was designed to resemble an air tank and was mounted on the right 
		running board.&nbsp; The air tanks on the Heisler are hidden under the 
		boiler and mounting the whistle on the running boards would be out of place.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Instead, it was decided to mount it under the right side of the cab, 
		beside the fire&nbsp; pan.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style19">
        The design is identical to that of the Shay Whistle except the tube OD 
		was reduced to 1.5&quot; to better fit under the cab.&nbsp;&nbsp; The whistle 
		is secured with a couple 1.75&quot; ID hoops cut from tubing.&nbsp; The 
		whistle&nbsp; must be free to rotate for adjustment.&nbsp; Once the 
		whistle is adjusted properly it is tightened down with setscrews 
		through the hoops.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style10">

		<p class="style19">
        Photo above&nbsp; shows the whistle mounted beside the fire pan ---- the rusty 
		piece behind and above the whistle.&nbsp;&nbsp; The spark plug prevents 
		mounting the whistle higher.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the whistle is 
		mounted on a slight slope so that condensate will drain.&nbsp;
        The hoop mounts are connected to the frame with short lengths of 1/8&quot; X 
		1/2&quot; bar stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rear piece of bar stock has several 
		bends to get the whistle positioned properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The whistle 
		can be dropped down out of the way by removing one screw per mount and 
		disconnecting the steam feed compression nut.&nbsp;&nbsp; Easy removable 
		is necessary to access the spark plug and the fire pan-burner nozzle 
		apparatus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<img height="541" src="Whistle2.jpg" width="800"></p>

		<p class="style19">
        This photo shows the whistle valve mounted below the gauges for the air 
		brake system.&nbsp; The valve input and output pipes are 1/4&quot; OD tubes 
		threaded MTP.&nbsp; The top of the whistle valve is threaded 1/8&quot; NPT.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The input pipe uses a 1/4&quot; MTP elbow into a 1/4&quot; MTP nipple 
		into a 1/4&quot; MTP to 1/8&quot; NPT 
		bushing.&nbsp; The 1/4&quot; MTP output pipe connects to the whistle via a 
		compression fitting to facilitate easy removal. </p>

        The whistle valve steam supply pipe connects to the main steam feed to the turret 
		via a 1/4&quot; NPT tee, a 1/4&quot; NPT to 1/8&quot; NPT bushing, a 1/8&quot; NPT ball 
		valve, a 1/8&quot; NPT elbow and 1/8&quot; NPT to 1/4&quot; OD tube compression elbow.&nbsp; 
		The compression fitting serves as a union.&nbsp; </p>
