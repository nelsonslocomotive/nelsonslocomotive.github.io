      section dimensions
      were fixed before starting on the crankcase.&nbsp; The inside distance
      between the frame sides on Cass 6 is 62&quot; which scales to
      8.3&quot;.&nbsp; I want as much room possible for the boiler so the inside
      spacing was increased to 8.5&quot;.&nbsp; That will permit a boiler
      diameter of 7.5&quot; with 0.25&quot; insulation and a thin
      jacket.&nbsp; The frame bars scale to 0.536&quot; which was increased to
      9/16&quot; square bar stock.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Crankcase &amp; Crosshead Guides:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Recall 
              that Heisler split the crankcase front-to-back and combined a 
              crosshead guide with each crankcase half.&nbsp; The initial plan 
      was to cast the crankcase as one piece and the crosshead guides separate 
      castings.&nbsp; The crankcase turned out to be too large to cast using the 
      envisioned investment casting techniques so it was split into two pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The half crankcase pattern made for investment casting was later 
      incorporated into a sand casting pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp; The crankcase is 
      made by bolting two halves together.&nbsp; The front has some areas 
      machined off for the rocker arm base and also to provide clearance&nbsp; 
      for the end of the rocker arms.&nbsp;&nbsp; The crosshead guides are 
      machined separately and then attached to the crankcase with screws.&nbsp; 
      The joints between the crosshead guides and the crankcase are filled with 
      an epoxy material and smoothed to resemble the fillets found on the 
      prototype castings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next three 
              drawings show the overall dimensions of the combined crankcase and 
              crosshead guides.&nbsp; These drawings incorporate the  
              decisions on the crankshaft from the&nbsp; Engine Design I page and the frame 
      dimensions above.</font></p>
