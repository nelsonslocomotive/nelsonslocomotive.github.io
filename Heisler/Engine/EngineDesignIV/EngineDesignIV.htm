        &nbsp;<p align="left"><font face="Arial">This is a continuation of Part III where the 
        cylinder casting and the main cylinder parts were described.&nbsp; In 
        this part the components associated with the valve side of the cylinders are described, starting with the valve bushing and valve.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Zeuner Valve Diagram:&nbsp; </b>The Zeuner diagram is 
        useful to show when the various events in the valve cycle occur.&nbsp; 
        The diagram construction procedure is described in&nbsp; the <u>Locomotive Design Part II - Valve 
        Motion </u>pamphlet mentioned earlier.&nbsp; I used a nearly identical 
        procedure described in Peterson's <u>SO YOU WANT TO BUILD A LIVE 
        STEAM&nbsp; LOCOMOTIVE</u>. </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The valve travel (or stroke) must be selected before the 
        diagram can be started. A stroke of 0.625&quot; was selected when the 
        eccentrics were laid out.&nbsp; This is slightly larger than the exact 
        scale dimension.&nbsp; The effects of typical valve train wear are more 
        pronounced on the scale model.&nbsp; Using the largest possible valve 
        travel 
        reduces the effect of wear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The first step in constructing the Zeuner diagram was to 
        lay out a circle with diameter equal to the valve travel.&nbsp; Since 
        the procedure is graphical, when working with a model, the diagram is 
        normally scaled up by a factor of 10 or 20 to increase accuracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        I did the diagram in TurboCAD which maintains accuracy at small scales 
        so I was able to use the actual dimensions. </font> </p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img border="0" src="ZeunerDiagram.jpg" width="700" height="503">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The diagram construction technique is described in the 
        references so I won't repeat it here.&nbsp; Rather, I'll try to explain 
        what the diagram indicates about the valve operation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        diagram shows the valve operation for one side of the piston.&nbsp; The 
        other side is the mirror image.&nbsp; The diagram is for a full gear 
        setting and 85% cutoff.&nbsp; The 85% cutoff means that the valve closes 
        cutting off steam admission at 85% of the piston stroke.&nbsp; The 
        design is for a 1/32&quot; lead ---- meaning the valve is open to admission 
        1/32&quot; when the piston is top or bottom dead center.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the 
        valve travel, percent cutoff and lead are specified, the diagram 
        pictured above can be generated.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first result of the diagram is the&nbsp; 
        Lap Circle, in this case a circle of 0.105&quot; radius.&nbsp; This means that a lap of 
        0.105&quot; is&nbsp; required.&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The valve port width must be selected to complete the 
        diagram.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bigger is better in that a wider port will allow more 
        steam to pass.&nbsp; However, the opening size is constrained by the 
        other valve dimensions, the most important being the need to have ample 
        space between the port and the steam admission port on one side and the 
        exhaust port on the other side. After several sizes were tried, a port 
        width of 0.187&quot; was determined to be near optimum and selected.&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The valve cycle begins at point A where the piston is 
        top or bottom dead center and the valve is open 1/32&quot; and beginning to admit steam. 
        The valve port is fully open at point  M and remains fully open 
        until point M' based on a port width of 0.187&quot; which was used to 
        construct arc KTL.&nbsp; The valve closes to admission (Cutoff) at point 
        F.&nbsp; The exhaust starts to open at point R and is open for half the 
        cycle ending at point S where compression starts.&nbsp; The valve then 
        starts to open to admission at point G and the cycle repeats. </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The effect of wear on the system is to delay the events.&nbsp; 
        The 1/32&quot; lead is meant to compensate some for wear and keep the 
        performance satisfactory. </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Both the references show diagrams that explain the 
        effects of hook-up&nbsp; (moving away from full gear) on the valve 
        events and are suggested reading for one interested in the subject.&nbsp; 
        The simple view is that hooking up the valve gear causes an earlier 
        cutoff and increases the compression period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;</i>Another good source is the Internet where a search of 
        &quot;Live Steam 
        Valve Motion<i>&quot; </i>will generate many hits including at least one site 
        offering free software that generates interesting graphics of the valve 
        events.&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">One last result from the diagram --- the 25.82 degree 
        angle between line RS and the horizontal.&nbsp; This means the 
        eccentrics should be set so the valve is centered 25.82 degrees before 
        the piston reaches dead center.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a comparison, Hiraoka 
        uses an angle of 25 degrees on his 3/4&quot; scale Heisler and Schroeder uses 
        10.5 degrees on his 1.5&quot; scale Shay.&nbsp; Schroeder uses no lead which 
        would reduce the angle some so we're in the right ball park.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Valve Bushing: </b>The drawing 
        below shows the valve bushing.&nbsp; It is very similar to the cylinder 
        bushing and will also be machined from cast iron rod.&nbsp; 
        The bushing will probably be made a tight sliding fit in the cylinder 
        casting and then be secured with Loctite. The steam admission port hole 
        will be drilled after the bushing has been fitted in the cylinder; the 
        port in the casting will be used to guide the drill.&nbsp; </font> </p>

        <p align="center">
        &nbsp;</p>
       
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The two sets of eight square holes 
        are the most critical part.&nbsp;&nbsp; The the recesses can be 
        accurately done on the lathe and serve as a guide for the holes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The holes will probably be drilled undersize and then carefully squared 
        with a file.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 16 round holes for the exhaust should be 
        drilled carefully but they are not as critical. &nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
       
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Valve Piston: </b>The next drawing shows a cross 
        section of the valve piston and rod.&nbsp; After screwing around 
        selecting various fills I decided to just use colors. </font> </p>
       
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The 3/16&quot; diameter rod is stainless. The lower end of 
        the rod will be threaded and passed through the valve stem head.&nbsp; I 
        didn't bother determining the correct length at this point. The rod is a 
        loose fit in the piston to accommodate the slight change in angle of 
        the rod as the rocker arm rocks.&nbsp; The shoulder just below the 
        valve is a piece of 3/8&quot; hex rod silver soldered to the stem.&nbsp; The nut and 
        washer on the upper end are also stainless. The nut must be a lock nut. The nut should be tightened so that 
        there is very little slack while still permitting the stem to move 
        side-to-side.&nbsp; There is no need to seal the center of the valve 
        since the two ends are inside the exhaust chambers.&nbsp;&nbsp; In many 
        cases on prototype locomotives the valve center is hollow and open 
        at the ends thus connecting the two exhaust chambers together creating a 
        larger exhaust passage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>

        <p align="center"><font face="Arial">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The valve body will be 
        bronze (SAE 660). The initial plan was to make cast iron rings following 
        the technique in Joseph Nelson's book motioned above.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        However, suitable 3/32&quot; wide cast iron rings are available from
        <a href="http://www.dol.net/~dave.reed/otto.html">Otto Gas Engine 
        Works</a> so I decided to buy the finished rings.&nbsp; Many model valves use 
        removable piston ends and a bull ring&nbsp; between the rings&nbsp;to permit sliding the rings onto the valve without 
        breaking them.&nbsp; I decided to make a one piece piston and hope the 
        rings can be slid into place without breaking.&nbsp; 
        (The pistons have now been fabricated and there is no problem sliding 
        the rings on the piston.). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The critical dimensions involve the rings. The rings 
        should have a&nbsp; 0.0015&quot; side clearance.&nbsp; The specified 
        rings are designed to work in a 3/32&quot; groove.&nbsp; The 1.625&quot; distance&nbsp;between the outer edge of the outer rings should exactly match the 
        distance between the outer sides of the ports on the valve bushing.&nbsp;
        The 1.040&quot; dimension between the inner edge of the rings should
        exactly match the distance between the inner sides of the ports on
        the valve bushing less twice the valve lap (0.210&quot;).&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Valve Heads:</b>&nbsp; The valve heads shown in the
        following drawing are straightforward and will be fabricated from brass 
        or steel stock..&nbsp; The 1.125&quot; diameter
        shoulder fits in the valve bushing to align the head.&nbsp; The lower
        head has a packing gland to seal the valve stem.&nbsp; The packing gland 
        will be made from a&nbsp; modified 5/16&quot;
        brass compression fitting silver soldered to the lower head..&nbsp; A 
        pair of 3/16&quot; ID 5/16&quot; OD Viton O-Rings will be used for the packing..&nbsp; The heads cover the low pressure exhaust chambers
        so the sealing task is much simpler than for the cylinder heads.</font></p>

        &nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Exhaust Manifolds: </b>The&nbsp; exhaust manifolds 
        carry the exhaust from the exhaust chambers at the ends of the valve 
        cylinder to the exhaust pipe.&nbsp; These passages are part of the 
        cylinder casting (created using sand cores) on the full size 
        locomotives.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the model, the manifold is attached to the 
        inner side of the cylinder adjacent to the valve cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The passages are formed by a recess in the inner side of the manifold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp; <b>Left Exhaust Manifold:</b>&nbsp; The drawing 
        above shows the left exhaust manifold..&nbsp; The inner recess is 
        0.625&quot; wide and 0.25&quot; deep which will gives free flow to the 
        5/8&quot; OD - 
        1/2&quot; ID exhaust pipe.&nbsp; The manifold can be machined from cast 
        iron, mild steel or aluminum.&nbsp; I plan to use aluminum.&nbsp; Once the manifold is installed, it 
        is unlikely that it will ever need to be removed so rather than using a 
        gasket, maybe high temperature Loctite (620) or 510 Flange Sealant 
        should beused to seal the 
        manifold to the cylinder casting..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
