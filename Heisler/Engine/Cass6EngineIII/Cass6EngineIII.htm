              cylinder.&nbsp; The cylinder and steam chest is a single

              7&quot; longer front-to-back than the left cylinder-steam
              chest.&nbsp; Also observe that the steam chest is tapered
              slightly back to front. Those are cylinder cocks with an operating
              link directly under the cylinder.&nbsp; The valve in the lower
              part of the steam chest serves the same function as the cylinder
              cocks --- to drain off condensate.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a snifter
              valve in the upper front of the steam chest.&nbsp;
              <p>The upper head has been installed but the head nuts haven't
              been installed.&nbsp; The head cover has not been installed

              <p>It is my guess that the packing gland was moved inside the

              limit the distance the cylinders stick out from the
              locomotive.&nbsp; That resulting bulge on the upper side of the

      <p>The overall dimensions on the above drawing are fairly accurate.&nbsp;
      However, the detailed shape of the heads are a guess.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      bottom side of the lower head will likely have a ridge of some kind to
      keep it centered on the crosshead guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
