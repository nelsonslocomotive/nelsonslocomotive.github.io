      <font face="Arial">We're down to laying out the very last part of the engine, the eccentric 
      straps and eccentric links which are described 
      in this page.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several composite drawings of the valve linkage 
      are also presented.&nbsp; These drawings were made to verify that 
      everything fits together.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>

      <font face="Arial">The photo above shows the MRSR 91 eccentric straps and eccentric rods.&nbsp; 
      Note that each strap is composed of two straps, one inside the other.&nbsp; 
      The inner strap is 
      free to rotate through roughly a 45 degree arc relative to the outer 
      strap.</font></p>

      <font face="Arial">This end view of the strap shows that the inner part is split as is the 
      outer part. In the orientation in the photo the seam in the inner strap is 
      nearly in line with the seam in the outer strap.&nbsp; (These two seams 
      are not aligned in the previous photo.&nbsp; The locomotive was moved 
      between the time the two photos were taken ) The brass colored 
      ring is the edge of the bearing between the inner ring and the eccentric.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      There doesn't seem to be a bearing between the inner and outer straps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I was fortunate to see a beautiful 1.5&quot; scale Heisler built to Kozo Hiraoka's design at about the same time I was struggling to 
            fabricate the eccentric straps.&nbsp;&nbsp; A quick look at the 
            engine revealed that Kozo used the much simpler eccentric strap design shown on the 
            right.&nbsp; The two reversing links will not run exactly the same 
            with this arrangement but suspect that the difference is not detectable.&nbsp; 
            The sample I observed ran smooth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <b>Combined Eccentric Straps:</b> The sketch above shows the combined 
      outer and inner straps.&nbsp; The inner strap is the bearing surface with 
      the eccentric.&nbsp; The inner strap also provides a bearing surface 
      with the outer strap enabling the inner and outer straps to rotate about 
      45 degrees with respect to each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; This sketch is a copy 
      of the original design of the straps which have been built and in 
      operation on the motor.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a problem in that the maxim 
      rotation between the two straps was initially too small.&nbsp; The sides 
      of the inner strap tab was thinned to provide the required rotation.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The width of the tabs on the following designs are thinner to allow greater 
      rotation between the straps.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <font face="Arial">The drawing above shows the inner eccentric strap which will be 
      machined in bearing bronze.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tab&nbsp; is mild steel silver 
      soldered to the bronze ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring will be sawed in half 
      after the inter strap, outer strap and eccentric have been assembled and 
      adjusted as necessary so that everything moves smoothly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The eccentric rod fits in the 
      tab.&nbsp; Each eccentric rod is held in place by a pair of 6-32 screws. 
      The nuts for these screws are toward the front of the locomotive so that 
      they can be loosened and the rods adjusted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      eccentric and straps closest to the crankcase are for&nbsp; forward.&nbsp; 
      The holes in these straps are threaded and the screws put into the tabs 
      and secured with Loctite.&nbsp; The eccentric rod used with the straps for 
      forward will have slots to allow some adjustment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      eccentric and straps for the reverse direction are at the front of the 
      engine.&nbsp; The eccentric rods for the reverse direction will have 
      threaded holes and have the screws secured with Loctite.&nbsp; The 
      eccentric straps for the reverse direct will&nbsp; have slots in the tabs.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      The two halves will need to be fastened together before the inside is 
      turned to the correct diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;The bronze inner 
      eccentric strap will wear over time and the straps will become loose and 
      sloppy.&nbsp; The surface where HM139 and HM140 join can be filed as 
      necessary to compensate for this wear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      The excess movement necessitated that the position of the tumbling arm

      rod and the tumbling arm.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;numerous variations of&nbsp;the 
      position of the pivot as well as the size and position of the rocker arms 
      were tried before the final design was selected.&nbsp;&nbsp; The drawing
