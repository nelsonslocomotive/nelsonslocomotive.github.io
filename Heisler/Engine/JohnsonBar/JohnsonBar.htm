        The pair of arms located under the right cylinder transfer the motion of 
		the long link from the Johnson Bar to the ball joints which link to the 
		Tumbling Lever (see Engine Design VII page).&nbsp; I've chosen to call 
		the long bar to the Johnson Bar the Jonson Bar Link&nbsp; and the two 
		arms the Outer Valve Control Arm and the Inner Valve Control Arm.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The bearing block connecting the two arms is called the Valve Control 
		Arm Bearing Block.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

		screws are threaded down through the engine bracket and secured with 
		Loctite so that they function as studs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note the use 
		of a 3/32 key locking the outer arm to the shaft between the arms.&nbsp; 
		A similar key is used between the inner arm and the shaft. </p>
