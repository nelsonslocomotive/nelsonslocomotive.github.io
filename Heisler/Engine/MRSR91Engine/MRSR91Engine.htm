      <p align="left">The Mt. Rainier Scenic Railroad # 91 Heisler locomotive was examined on September 24 and 25, 2004. The
      
      engine appears to use the same parts as Cass 6 except for:&nbsp; </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The cylinder castings</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The valve (piston vs. slide)</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The eccentric straps &amp; pivoting eccentric
          rods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These parts that are different are described below.&nbsp; Also, one of
      the connecting&nbsp; rod bearings was off so I was able to learn more
      about the bearing and strap.&nbsp; The details of the bearing and strap
      are probably identical to Cass 6 but are described here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>Eccentric Straps:&nbsp; </b>Since MRSR 91 uses the piston valves
      which require much less force to operate than slide valves, the components
      that drive the valves were inspected to see if any changes were made from
      the earlier design.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only change detected is the eccentric
      strap and eccentric rods.&nbsp;&nbsp; The earlier design used on Cass 6
      and the later design on MRSR 91 are both shown below,</p>

              early design eccentric strap has one of the rods rigidly attached

              This pivoting rod has a fixed length.&nbsp; The rigid rod is
              attached by three bolts through elongated holes in the rod.&nbsp;
              The rigid rod length can be adjusted by loosening the bolts and
              sliding the rod.&nbsp; Mr. Artie Barkley, the Cass shop foreman told
              me the procedure to adjust the valves is to set to full gear with
              the piston at the extreme and the pivoting rod lifting the
              reversing link.&nbsp; Then adjust the valve stem for correct
              lead.&nbsp; The reverse lever is then set full gear in the

              In this later design the bolts (or maybe studs) are fixed in the
