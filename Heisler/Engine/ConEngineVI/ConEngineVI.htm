      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The photo above shows the valve stem heads, rocker arms and rocker arm base in 
      position.&nbsp; It is at this point that the valve rods were trimmed to the 
      proper length by positioning the valve piston in the middle of the valve 
      cylinder and adjusting the position of the valve stem head such that it 
      lined up with the rocker arm when the rocker arm was at a 45 degree angle.&nbsp; At least a 1/4&quot; excess length 
      was left on the rod for 
      subsequent adjustment. </font> </p>
        

        
      

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The valve rod is a smaller diameter 
      than the hole though the center of the valve piston which gives the valve 
      stem head some slack to move perpendicular to the direction of the valve 
      motion. &nbsp; The 
      position of the rocker arm base should be adjusted front-to-back as 
      necessary so that the valve stem head lines up with the opening in the 
      rocker arm without stress the valve rod.&nbsp;&nbsp; The flanges on the 
      sleeve bearings in one of the valve stem heads can be thinned or shimmed 
      if necessary if the two valve stem heads are not directly across from each 
      other.&nbsp; </font></p>
        

        
      

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Next, the base was adjusted 
      left-to-right and up-or-down such that that the link block pin holes in 
      the rocker arm and valve stem head line up.&nbsp; This may require 
      trimming material off the bottom of the base to make it lower or shimming 
      it to make it higher.&nbsp; Once this was done, the base was clamped in 
      place and the link block pins installed and each valve piston movement of&nbsp; 
      5/16&quot; up and 5/16&quot; down tested to verify that there was no side-to-side 
      stress on the valve rod.&nbsp; The position of the base should be adjusted 
      further if necessary so that the valve rod is not under side-to-side 
      stress over the entire valve movement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once this was verified, 
      the mounting holes for the base were drilled into the crankcase (using the 
      base as a template) and then tapped 6-32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Photo above shows the assembled valve 
      linkages.&nbsp; The next step was to adjust the valves.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
      number of years&nbsp; ago Artie Barkley 
      at Cass told me to adjust the eccentric rods first and then the valves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      I did that and it worked great.&nbsp;&nbsp; I took the upper valve heads 
      off and used a depth gauge to determine the position of the valve.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      I then adjusted the eccentric rods as necessary such that the upper most travel of 
      each valve is the same in forward and reverse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the 
      nuts on the valve rod lower end were adjusted so that the valve opening (as seen 
      through the inspection ports) was the same when the main piston was top dead 
      center and bottom dead center.&nbsp; If everything is correct, the valve 
      is open about 0.01&quot; when the piston is at the top and at the bottom.&nbsp;

      between the cylinders and the upper frame bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those items and 
      anything else that crops up will probably be covered in another web page 
      to be done later.&nbsp; </font></p>
