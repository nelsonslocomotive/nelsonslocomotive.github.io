      <p align="left">Heisler referred to the engine on their locomotive as the <b>Motor</b>,
      or <b>Motor Engine</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This terminology must have been
      introduced by the marketing department when the engineers were all out to
      lunch.&nbsp; I can't bring myself to call the engine the motor ---- I'd keep
      looking for the power cord.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I am however able to put <b>motor
      oil</b> in my <b>automobile engine</b>.)&nbsp;</p>


      <p align="left">&nbsp;The Cass 6 Engine Description is divided into five
      parts as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Part I - overview of engine.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Part II - crankcase, crankshaft and bearings.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Part IIl - cylinders, heads, pistons and rods.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Part IV - rocker arm base plus rocker
          arms, valve stems and valve stem heads.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Part V - tumbling arm, reversing links, reversing link
          hangers and eccentrics straps. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">We start off with the most distinguishing characteristic of the
      Heisler locomotive -----the cylinders that stick out the side pointing up at
      a 45 degree angle.</p>

              when looking at the right cylinder photos as well as the actual
              cylinder,&nbsp; I was curious as to why the rectangular section between
              the cylinder and the steam chest was so long.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
              trip in June, 2004, I tried to measure the offset between the two
              valve stems as an easy way of estimating the offset between the
              two cylinders.&nbsp; Surprise! The two valve stems are in
              alignment.&nbsp; It was then I measured the two cylinders more
              carefully and found them different.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rods are
              offset by 7&quot; with the right rod further back.&nbsp; The rectangular
              part of the right cylinder casting&nbsp; is 7&quot; longer to compensate.&nbsp;
              <p>The composite photo on the right shows the right cylinder (upper) and left cylinder (lower) in a similar orientation.&nbsp;
              The difference between the steam chest part of the two cylinders in obvious in this
              photo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Al Armitage's drawings of West Side Lumber Co #2 and Kozo Hiraoka's
              Heisler both have the two cylinders identical with the valve stems offset by the
              same amount as the cylinders are offset.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Some of the photos in the Heisler Marketing brochure suggest
              that the change was made on the later heavier
              locomotives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
