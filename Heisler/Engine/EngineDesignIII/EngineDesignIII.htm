        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The layout of the cylinders 
        and valves is more complicated than just scaling the full size 
        locomotive.&nbsp; For example, direct scaling of wall thickness is not 
        practical unless very close tolerances are employed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another 
        complication is the steam passages between the valve and the steam 
        input/exhaust and the valve and between the valve and the cylinder.&nbsp; 
        On the full size cylinders these passages are made as part of the 
        casting process by using sand cores that are shaken out after the parts 
        are cast.&nbsp; The design process must include a technique to machine 
        these passages.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;I lack the knowledge and experience necessary to 
        make the rule of thumb judgments that are probably second nature to both 
        mechanical engineers and machinists (my background is electrical 
        engineering).&nbsp; To compensate, I've used Ken Schroeder's Shay design 
        as a model and tried to make all components at least as robust.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Also, emphasis was placed on making all components as tolerant as 
        possible of my kind of machining (sloppy).&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Another area of design concern is engine efficiency.&nbsp; 
        I've found that my little shay has much more power than needed when 
        running on a flat track or tracks that model a mainline where the grades 
        are on the order of 1.5% or less.&nbsp; However, the geared locomotives 
        typically were used on branch and logging lines where 3% grades were 
        the norm and 6% and greater grades were not uncommon.&nbsp; I usually run 
        my shay at the Mill Creek Central track that has long 3% grades.&nbsp; On 
        that track it's a constant effort to maximize power to climb the hills 
        and then try to  down when descending ---- which makes it
        really fun to run.&nbsp; With this in 
        mind, I made the steam passages and ports as large as possible to improve 
        efficiency in that area.&nbsp;&nbsp; The operating steam pressure of the 
        model will be 100 psi vs. 200 psi for the full size prototype.&nbsp; The 
        correct 1.6&quot; scale pressure would be 27 psi so the model will use much 
        greater than scale pressure.&nbsp; This greater pressure will permit a 
        somewhat smaller than scale steam and exhaust passage.&nbsp; 
        The valve design was done using a reprint of 
        design techniques described in <u>Locomotive Design Part II - Valve 
        Motion</u>.&nbsp; This pamphlet (No 28) published in1910 was originally 
        published in Railway Machinery.&nbsp; The pamphlet was purchased from 
        Nation Builder Books,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nbbooks.com/">
        www.nbbooks.com</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The design process involved numerous iterations where 
        everything was sketched out and then modified to achieve the objectives 
        outlined above and sketched again.&nbsp; Hopefully, this process will 
        minimize revisions after the engine is built.&nbsp; </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The table below summarizes parameters arrived at 
        during this iterative process.&nbsp; The decision on the bore and stroke 
        were based on reasonable power and achievable steam as describe in the 
        Heisler Engine I page.&nbsp; The crosshead guide ID decision was also 
        described in the Engine I page.&nbsp;&nbsp; The valve-cylinder spacing 
        and the valve stroke were determined before the crankcase, &nbsp;crankshaft and eccentrics were laid out, also 
        discussed in the Engine I page&nbsp; 
        The rationale for some of the other compromises are described   
        in this page.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some values in the MRSR 91 column 
        are preceded by the &quot;<b>~</b>&quot; symbol.&nbsp; These values are estimates 
        based on other measurements or estimates made from&nbsp; photographs.&nbsp; 
        For example, the MRSR 91 cylinder heads were hidden by the head covers. 
        The head OD value of ~ 21&quot; was based on the overall cylinder OD, the 
        head cover OD and the head diameter of a slightly small Heisler engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </b>Note from the table above I chose to use a slightly oversize 
        cylinder OD ( 2.91&quot; vs. 2.81&quot; scale).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The cylinder length was stretched a little over 
        5% (3.25&quot; vs. 3.08&quot; scale).&nbsp; This slightly longer cylinder together 
        with a slightly shorter stroke gives enough room to make the piston 
        with a flat top and bottom instead of having a recess in the piston 
        bottom and a bulge in the piston top.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of a bulge in 
        the top allows the upper head to be flat and eliminates a bulge in the 
        head cover.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before fixing the cylinder length the overall 
        engine was sketched out and the relationship to the frame and boiler 
        examined as shown in the next drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        between the upper and lower frame bars of 40&quot; scales to 5.36&quot;
        which was increased to 5.437&quot; for the model.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The outside edge of the cab should&nbsp; line up with the center of the 
        cylinder head cover and the outer edge of the walkway should 
        line up with the upper corner of the cylinder castings.&nbsp; The 
        drawing above shows this to be the case on the model once the cylinder 
        head and head cover are added, so the esthetics are preserved.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Another concern was that there was room between the cylinder casting and 
        the boiler for the exhaust pipe.&nbsp; The drawing shows that there is 
        plenty of room so we should be OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>

              slightly and steam will travel from the admission port, around the 
              narrow middle part of the piston and out the partially uncovered 
              port to the cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </td>

        <p align="left" class="style1">Update 7/3/2011:&nbsp; The drawings of 
		the left and right cylinders shown below were replaced to correct an 
		error in the exhaust passages on the inside the valve cylinder.&nbsp; </p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Left Cylinder:&nbsp; </b>The next drawing 
        shows the left cylinder which contains both the main cylinder 
        and the valve cylinder.&nbsp; Both cylinders are oversize to accommodate 
        bushings (sleeves).&nbsp; </font> </p>

        <img height="442" src="HM107_LeftCylinder.jpg" width="700"></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The cylinder is basically a chunk of 
        cast iron with two holes for the cylinders and a hole for the admission 
        pipe out the side.&nbsp; The cylinder will be machined from a 
        length of 4.5&quot; diameter gray cast iron rod.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sides of the 
        rod will turned to flats on the lathe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cylinder holes 
        are the most critical, both in diameter and the spacing between the two 
        holes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cylinder holes will be bored on the lathe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rounded sides will be 
        achieved 
        by mounting the block on the rotary table and rotating it under an end 
        mill.&nbsp;&nbsp; The recess for the exhaust manifold will be milled out. </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The cylinder heads, valve heads, and 
        exhaust manifold are all attached with 6-32 screws.&nbsp; The depth of 
        the threaded holes for the cylinder heads and valve heads were not shown 
        to reduce drawing clutter.&nbsp; A depth of 0.375&quot; is reasonable for all 
        these holes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The holes for the exhaust manifold attachment 
        screws were also omitted.&nbsp; The locations of these holes are shown 
        on the manifold drawing. </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The steam passages add a bit of character to the cylinder 
        casting.&nbsp; The steam admission is&nbsp;via the 3/8&quot; NPT hole in the 
        side of the valve cylinder.&nbsp; The exhaust passage is via the rectangular holes near each end of the valve 
        cylinder.&nbsp; There is a recess in the exhaust manifold 
        that routes the exhaust to the exhaust port on the manifold.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The passages between the valve cylinder and the main 
        cylinder will be machined.&nbsp; The first step (after the cylinders are 
        bored to the correct size) will be to machine the 1/4&quot; wide passages in 
        the side of the valve cylinder.&nbsp; This will be done using a 1/4&quot; 
        wide 1.125&quot; diameter Woodruff key slot cutter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The inner 
        passages are 1/4&quot; deep&nbsp; except in the area under the exhaust 
        manifold where the depth is 1/8&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The outer passages used 
        for exhaust are also 1/4&quot; deep except in the area between the cylinders 
        where they are only 1/8&quot; deep.&nbsp;&nbsp; The slot between the outer recesses and the exhaust 
        manifold will be opened using an end mill from the manifold side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">A 1.5&quot; diameter cutter can also be used to 
        cut the recess in the side of the main cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The depth 
        of the recess varies from about 3/16&quot; at the ends to sufficient depth 
        in the middle to provide two passages between the two cylinders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The vertical slots in the side of the main cylinder are cut with a 0.75&quot; 
        diameter woodruff cutter. &nbsp;&nbsp; The cutter is moved vertically to create the 
        slots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rotary tool can probably be used to deepen 
        the slots without breaking into the head screw holes.
        </font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">These passages do not require close 
        tolerances; the openings in the bushings are the critical dimensions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The most critical part of machining the steam passages is to avoid 
        cutting through the side of the casting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        head with the inside of the main cylinder bushing and the 1.748&quot; 
        diameter shoulder that fits inside the cylinder reduces free space

        between the cylinder casting and the flange on the upper end of the 
        crosshead guide.&nbsp; The 1.748 diameter shoulder on the lower side of 
        the head aligns the head with the inside of the crosshead guide.&nbsp; 
        The head bolts pass through the flange on the crosshead guide and the 
        head flange into the cylinder casting.&nbsp;&nbsp;The packing gland is similar to 
        the gland Ken Schroeder used on his shay and will be machined from 
        bronze rod. The packing will be a pair of&nbsp; 5/16&quot; ID, 7/16&quot; OD Viton 
        O-Rings .&nbsp; The socket head cap screws that hold the packing gland 
        will be lined up horizontally.&nbsp; Hopefully it will be possible to 
        access these screws with a long hex driver up through the crankcase.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Update 4/12/2017:&nbsp; The 
		OD of the O-Rings used for packing was incorrectly shown as 9/16&quot;.&nbsp; 
		Also, I've switched to PTFE O-Rings&nbsp; for this packing on the&nbsp; 
		Shay and I think I did on the Heisler too.&nbsp; One side of the O-Ring 
		is cut so it can be slipped over the rod and pushed into the recess.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Rex Smith who is building a Heisler pointed out the the Packing Gland&nbsp; 
		shown in the photos in the construction page seemed to be larger than 
		the 1.375&quot; OD shown on the drawing.&nbsp; Apparently I made the OD 1.75&quot;&nbsp; 
		using the same material as the Crossheads.&nbsp;&nbsp; The holes 
		retaining the glands were also further apart.&nbsp; Either size is OK, 
		the only critical part is that which holds the packing in the recess in 
		the head.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left" class="style2"><strong>Update 7/4/2011: After about 100 
		hours of operation a leak developed in the left cylinder rod packing.&nbsp; 
		It turned out that the one of the packing gland screws came out and the 
		second screw became loose enough so the packing gland was dropping down 
		and hitting the top of the crosshead (which explains one of the engine 
		knocks).&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while that second screw broke in half.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		So, off with the boiler so that the cylinder could be removed to get at 
		the broken screw.&nbsp; The new screws have lock washers and were 
		secured with Loctite 620.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did the same for the screws on 
		the other side before they backed out</strong>. </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Head Gaskets:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
        made head gaskets for the Shay which worked fine but took some effort.&nbsp;
