      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">We had record cold last year here in central Ohio.&nbsp; 
      (Since temperatures have been in a downturn&nbsp;the last decade while 
      CO2 levels have increased I see that political correct term is no longer 
      &quot;global warming&quot;, it is now &quot;climate change&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a good 
      move since the climate has changed constantly since the earth was born, 
      they can't be wrong.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo above was taken from the shop 
      window.&nbsp; Those guys drilled holes through the foot thick ice to drop 
      their lines.&nbsp; I walked out one day and had a chat.&nbsp; They weren't 
      catching anything --- but seemed to be enjoying an inner warmth from some 
      100 proof and also relishing the escape from their partners.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Fortunately, I have a shop for my escape.&nbsp; </font> </p>
        

      

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;I had recently given up hope on doing investment 
      castings for the cylinders.&nbsp; One alternative was to get a one foot&nbsp; 
      length of 4 1/2&quot; diameter cast iron bar stock and try to machine cylinders 
      that resemble castings.&nbsp; It turned out to go really well and I now 
      wonder why I considered castings for those parts.&nbsp; </font> </p>
