              the valves with the eccentric straps.&nbsp; We were lucky to find a
              spare strap so the measuring and photographing was much
              easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>That is a bearing inside the casting--- maybe babbitt metal.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Two rods fasten to the top of the strap, one connecting to each
              reversing link.&nbsp;&nbsp; The left rod that is fastened with
              three bolts is fixed (but can be adjusted).&nbsp;&nbsp; The right rod that is fastened
              with a pin is the the pivoting rod.&nbsp; The orientation of the
              strap in the photo of the front eccentric strap used
              for engine reverse.&nbsp; The back strap is reversed left to right
              with the fixed strap on the right.&nbsp; The back strap is used for
              engine forward&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              closest to the camera is a fixed rod and the one further away is a
              pivoting rod.&nbsp;<p>The reversing links&nbsp; front to
              back&nbsp; position is such that they are centered on the joint between the two eccentrics. The forked
              ends of the rods are offset so that the center of the fork is also
              aligned with the joint between the two eccentrics.&nbsp; This symmetry
              allows one design to be used for both sets of straps and

              The reversing link block slides in the the slot in the reversing

              connects to the rocker arm and valve stem head.&nbsp; When the eccentric rod moves the
              reversing link up and down the motion is coupled via the reversing
              link block&nbsp; and rocker arm to the valve stem and on to the

              <p>The reversing link is connected to the link hanger via the

              are the only valve components that are easy to photograph and
              measure ---they sort of hang at the top of the pile.&nbsp;
              <p>The reversing link hanger connects the tumbling arm to the
              reversing link.&nbsp; When the tumbling arm rotates, the revering
              link is forced to slide along the link bock.&nbsp; As the
              reversing link moves, the fixed eccentric rod forces&nbsp; the
              associated eccentric strap to rotate on the eccentric.&nbsp; At
              the extremes of the tumbling arm rotation, one of the eccentric
              rods is directly under the valve stem head and the engine is set
              for forward or reverse.&nbsp; When the tumbling arm is in the
              middle of it's rotation the valve stem head is positioned in the
              middle of the reversing link, midway between to two eccentric rods
              and there will be no valve stem
              movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              didn't have CAD systems back then so maybe they made all the other
              valve parts and put them together and then designed this last
              part so that everything would connect.&nbsp;&nbsp; (That technique
              will likely be used on the model.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <p align="left">The sketch above shows the valve linkage positions when
      the reversing lever is in the neutral
      position.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Recall that there are two valve adjustments , the valve
      stem head can be moved on the valve stem (two nuts)&nbsp; and the fixed
      eccentric rod can be moved relative to the eccentric strap (slotted holes
      in the rod secured by 3 bolts)&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cass shop foreman Artie
      Barkley told me how to do the adjustment so best document it here before I
      forget it.&nbsp; The reversing lever is set to the position that puts the
      upper end of a&nbsp; pivoting eccentric rod in line with the valve
      stem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The piston is moved to top dead center and the
      valve stem head is then adjusted (two nuts on stem)&nbsp; for the desired
      valve lead.&nbsp; The second valve stem head&nbsp; is adjusted before
      adjusting the fixed eccentric rods.&nbsp; Next, the reversing lever is set
      so that the upper end of a&nbsp;fixed eccentric rod is in line with the
      valve stem and the piston moved to top dead center.&nbsp; The three bolts
      holding the rod to the eccentric strap are loosened and the rod
      moved to the position that gives the desired valve lead. The second fixed
      eccentric rod is then adjusted using the same
      procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
