      that fit in the holes in the upper end of the piston.&nbsp; The 1&quot; 
      diameter hole through the wrench allows a deep socket to be used on the 
      locking nut.&nbsp;&nbsp; The process will be to install the crosshead and 
      rod through the crankcase and the piston through the upper end of the 
      cylinder.&nbsp; A ring compressor will help get the rings inside the 
      cylinder. A rod can be inserted through the hole in the crosshead to keep 
      it from turning.&nbsp; The piston wrench can then be used to screw the 
      piston onto the rod.&nbsp; The jam nut can then be fitted to the end of 
      the rod and a socket used to tighten it while the piston wrench keeps the 
      piston from turning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>

            cutting off the pipe thread end and a brass plug silver soldered 
            inside.&nbsp; The fitting was chucked in the lathe and the hex part 
            of the body&nbsp; turned to 0.400&quot; diameter a distance of 1/4&quot; from 
            the end.&nbsp; The body was then silver soldered into a 13/32&quot; hole 
            in the lower head.&nbsp; The head was then chucked, the protruding 
            part of the fitting shortened to 5/16&quot; and the inside step bored to 
            match the drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp; A plug was silver soldered in the 
            closed end of the nut and the plug then drilled/reamed 13/64&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      A lock nut will be used at the top end.&nbsp; Stainless steel washers will 
      be used at each end of the valve. The lock nut will be tightened just 
      enough to remove most the slack but still allow the rod to move side to side 
      to match the rocker arm motion.&nbsp; 
      The lower end of the stem will be cut to length and threaded after the 
      valve linkage has been assembled so the correct length can be determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;
