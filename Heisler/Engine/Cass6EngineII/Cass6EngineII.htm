        The details of the lower engine are discussed here.&nbsp; The starting
        point is the crankcase castings shown in the following three
        drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              half.&nbsp; The cylinders bolt to the flange on the outer end of
              the&nbsp; crosshead guides. The drawings above and on the right show&nbsp;
              the crankcase split apart.&nbsp;
              <p>Note that the outside of main casting is not cylindrical; there

              outer edge of the crankshaft&nbsp;
              counterweights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems Heisler packed about
