      <p align="left">The valves on the Heisler are very compact and use fewer parts
      than other locomotive designs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo
      above shows the upper part of the the left side valve system with some of
      the parts labeled.&nbsp; The objective of the valve system is to move the
      valve stem up and down at the correct time. The valve stem head is
      attached to the lower end of the valve stem.&nbsp; The valve stem head is
      also attached to the rocker arm.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rocker arm is hinged at
      the rocker arm base so the valve stem head actually moves along an arc
      rather than exactly along the axis of the valve stem.&nbsp; The arc radius
      is relatively large and the angle traveled is very small so the deviation
      from a straight path is small.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been told that the valve
      stem bends slightly to accommodate the deviation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">The rocker arm and valve stem are driven by the reversing
      link via the link block.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reversing link is
      positioned by the link hanger via the link saddle.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo
      shows the link block near one end of the reversing link which corresponds
      to the engine running in one direction&nbsp; ---- the reversing lever in
      the cab is near one extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I traced the linkage
      correctly, this is the link position for forward.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
      reversing lever in the cab is moved to the rear, the link hanger will push
      the reversing link out on the link block to a position where the link
      block is near the other extreme of the reversing link.&nbsp; The engine
      will run in the reverse direction at that setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Valves2.jpg" width="720" height="549"> </p>
      <p align="left">This photo shows the lower portion of the valve
      gear.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two eccentrics on the crankshaft which serve
      both cylinders.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each eccentric has an eccentric strap.&nbsp;
      Each eccentric strap strap has two eccentric rods, one fixed and one
      pivoting.&nbsp;&nbsp; One rod from each strap goes to each reversing
      link.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the photo, the fixed rod on the rear eccentric strap
      connects to the left side (right side of photo) reversing link.&nbsp; This
      connection is right under the valve stem so it is this rod and the rear
      eccentric that is controlling the left cylinder.&nbsp; The pivoting rod on
      the rear eccentric strap goes to the other reversing link and will be
      directly under that side valve stem and be driving that valve.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      So, in the forward direction, the rear eccentric and rear eccentric strap
      drives both valve stems.&nbsp;&nbsp; The direction is controlled by the
      tumbling arm.&nbsp; If the tumbling arm is rotated clockwise as far as it
      will go, the reversing links will also move to the right&nbsp; and
      position the front eccentric strap rods under the valve stems to drive
      the valves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
