              removed.&nbsp; A cylindrical puller tool is used to force 
              the rod out of the piston.&nbsp; The tool screws onto the  treaded stub at the top of the piston.&nbsp; A rod that is 
              threaded into the top of the tool is then tightened against the 
              piston rod to force it out of the piston.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      line it with an off-the-shelf bronze sleeve bearing so that it can be
      replaced without replacing the entire crosshead.&nbsp; Grease lubrication 
        will be provided to the bearing via a hole through the pin.&nbsp; No adjustment mechanism 
        was made for the bearing surfaces that rub against the
      crosshead guide.&nbsp; It seems that machining new crossheads every few
      years or tens of years would be easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoulder will be 
        turned and rod hole will be 
        drilled and threaded first.&nbsp; The rod will then be screwed into 
        place and secured with high temperature Loctite. After the Loctite sets, 
        the 1/16&quot; hole in the shoulder will be extended through the rod and a 
        tension pin driven into the hole.&nbsp; The rod will then be chucked in the 
        lathe and the outer round surface finished to dimension.&nbsp; This 
        technique should assure that the rod and crosshead are perfectly 
        aligned.&nbsp; </font> </p>

        strap pressing against a 1/8&quot; thick steel plate.&nbsp; This bolt will 
        look very similar to the grease fitting on MRSR 91.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The bearing is two identical halves that will machined from bronze bar 
        stock.&nbsp; 
        The strap will be fabricated from mild steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 0.9375&quot; 
        bearing length is OK if the rods are exactly centered.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Unfortunately, it's likely the rods will be off the design position by 
        up to 1/16&quot; or more.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The bearing should be made 
        extra long and then trimmed such 
        that the rod is centered on the cross head guide and there is no side 
        float.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Before wrapping up the connecting rod, the rod and 
        strap were pasted on the crankcase drawing shown above to see how everything fits 
        together.&nbsp; The rod on the left is 
        positioned all the way up to check that the rod pin lines up with the 
        access hole in the crosshead guide.&nbsp; The rod on the right is 
        positioned at the point where the rod side is closest to the hitting the 
        side of the crosshead --- it clears with a little margin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The ground clearance was also checked and found to be a little over 1.5&quot;
        above the rail head when the rod is position at the lowest point&nbsp;&nbsp;
