      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The engine is now complete and 
      operating so it's time to document how the parts were fabricated.&nbsp; 
      Some of the parts described in this page were made a couple years 
      ago (fortunately I finally found the photos) and others were made in the past 
      month.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The technique of building up complex pieces by 
      silver soldering simpler pieces together is copied from Kozo Hiroaka.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Many photos and few words is the easiest way to tell this story. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
