      		  <strong>Model Pipe Threads:</strong> This is the first plumbing 
				done on the Heisler for several years.&nbsp; In the interval 
				from doing the Shay plumbing and the earlier plumbing on the 
				Heisler I've changed the threads I'm using on the scale pipes.&nbsp; 
				I became disillusioned with the MTP thread for the following 
				reasons: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					<p class="style6">The taps and dies are very expensive</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p class="style6">Considerable force is required on the dies</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p class="style6">Even with the correct taps and dies the 
					fit is often not good.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p class="style6">In many cases even very tight fittings 
					leak and require a sealant.&nbsp; </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="style6">
      		  I now use 40 TPI straight threads for all the fittings&nbsp; 
				--- 1/8&quot;, 3/16&quot;. 1/4&quot; and 5/16&quot;.&nbsp; Straight thread taps and 
				dies are readily available from Enco for half or 1/4 the price 
				of MTP taps and dies.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Standard 5-40 taps and dies 
				are used for the 1/8&quot;-40 threads.) These straight thread dies 
				require much less force than the taper thread dies and work fine 
				on brass or hard copper tube.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I use a sealer 
				on all joints --- Loctite 567 in most cases and Loctite 620 for 
				joints I'd normally want to solder such as the ends of union 
				fittings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 620 softens when heated to about 600 
				degrees.</p>
				<p class="style6">
      		  PM Research has sold straight thread scale fittings for years.&nbsp; 
				There is an interesting note about the various threads on their 
				website. They now also sell MTP fittings as well as fittings 
				with a taper thread that 
				matches the thread profile of their straight thread fittings.</p>
				<p class="style6">
      		  I don't hesitate buying the MTP fittings and just run a straight 
				thread tap or die over the threads to make everything straight 
				thread. </p>
				<p class="style6">
      		  One exception to using the 40 TPI is fittings from Clippard which 
				use 10-32 threads.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the Clippard 
				regulators use the 10-32 thread.&nbsp; Once I leave those 
				fittings and go to tubing with scale fittings I transition to 
				the 40 TPI threads.</p>
				<p class="style6">
      		  One final point ----- unions are required on most pipe runs.&nbsp; 
				The scale unions look great but are frequently difficult to take 
				apart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard brass tube compression fittings are 
				much easier to use and about 1/3 the cost.&nbsp; However, the 
				compression fittings are 2 or 3 times scale size.&nbsp; My 
				compromise is to use scale unions in very visible places and 
				compression fittings in the less visible places.&nbsp;</p>

        The photo above shows the cylinder cocks on MRSR 91 which are very 
		similar or identical to those on Cass 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that there are 
		three cocks per cylinder, one on each end of the cylinder and a third in

				<td><span class="style6"><strong>Correction:&nbsp; </strong>
				Shortly after this page was posted Dave Fontes emailed with the 
				comment that <strong><em>the third valve </em></strong>
				<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: black">
				<strong><em>is tied into the bottom of the steam chest</em></strong>. 
				I went back and took a closer look at Cass 6 and found that 
				indeed the third valve is in the bottom of the steam chest, see 
				photo below.<br>
				<img height="356" src="Cass6Cocks.jpg" width="720"> <br>These 
				photos were taken in 2003 near the end of the restoration which 
				included the new boiler.&nbsp; The cocks are out of the left 
				cylinder but the holes indicating where they go are visible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Note that on the right side only two of the cocks have the 
				mechanical linkage and I assume that is the case on the left 
				side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the globe valve for the third 
				cock might indicate that it is not used as often as the cocks at 
				the ends of the cylinders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I replaced 
				the previous photo of the MRSR91 cocks with a photo that shows 
				the entire cylinders and piston valve areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking 
				back at that photo, those third cocks there seem to be between 
				the main cylinder and the valve cylinder in the area of the 
				passage between the the valve cylinder and the lower end of the 
				main cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is likely not the exhaust area 
				as originally thought.&nbsp; However, closer inspection of the 
				MRSR91 photo revealed what appears to be plugs at the lower end 
				of the valve cylinders.&nbsp; These may be drain plugs out of 
				the exhaust area, the lowest part of the valve cylinder and is 
				analogous to the drain cock in the lower part of the steam chest 
				on Cass 6. <br><br>I don't know the reason for the drain 
				mechanisms out of the steam chest/valve cylinders.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				One possibility is to drain any water to prevent freezing 
				problems in winter months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Thanks to 
				Dave Fontes for straightening me out on this.&nbsp; All comments 
				and input are welcome. </span></span></td>

        The cylinder cocks on the shay have worked very well (see 
		<a href="../../../Shay/Engine/CylinderCocks/CylinderCocks.htm">Shay Cylinder 
		Cocks</a>).&nbsp; They are are very close to scale and would work fine here.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		However, the mechanical linkage would be more difficult.</p>
		<p class="style6">
        It is my understanding that cylinder cocks are needed to remove 
		condensate from cold cylinders so that excess pressure doesn't build 
		during the compression phase (water is essentially non compressible).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I don't think that is a concern with small slide valve engines since 
		excess pressure will cause the valve to lift and excess pressure to 
		escape into the steam chest.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not the case with a 
		piston valve engine like this Heisler. </p>
		<p class="style6">
        After thinking about it for a while I decided to use steam 
		controlled 
		cylinder cocks.&nbsp; The plumbing of the steam control tube appeared to 
		be easier than the linkages required for mechanical cocks.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
		very attractive bonus with the steam controlled cocks is that excess 
		pressure in the cylinder will force the cocks open to relieve the 
		pressure even if the control valve is set to close the cocks.&nbsp; The 
		challenge is to make the cocks as small as possible so that they don't 
		look too much out of scale.&nbsp;&nbsp; This task is somewhat easier for 
		the Heisler than the Shay since the Heisler cylinders are much larger.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
