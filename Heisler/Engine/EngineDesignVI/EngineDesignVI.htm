      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The photo above shows the upper part of the valve linkage on 
      Cass 6.&nbsp; The eccentrics and associated straps and links are off the 
      bottom of the photo.&nbsp; The upper part of the valve linkage on MRSR 91 
      is identical to Cass 6.&nbsp; The modeling of the base for the rocker arm 
      and tumbling arm base, the rocker arm, valve stem head, reversing link and 
      link block are described here. &nbsp; 
      The remaining parts of the valve linkage are described in the Heisler 
      Engine Part VII and Part VIII pages.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The bearing&nbsp; surfaces for the valve linkage are 
      shafts, pins and the sliding surface between the link block and the 
      reversing link.&nbsp; Linkage wear introduces slack into the valve operation 
      that can significantly reduce the efficiency of an engine, especially a 
      scale model engine.&nbsp;&nbsp; To minimize wear, slightly over scale 
      bearing surfaces are used and inexpensive standard sleeve bearing inserts 
      are used on the shafts and pins.&nbsp;&nbsp; All bearing surfaces are 
      equipped with lubrication fittings which hopefully 
      will lead to minimum wear.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
