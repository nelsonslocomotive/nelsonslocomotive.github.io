				are difficult to machine because of the combination of 
				rectangular and round surfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp; To simplify the 
				process two shoes were fabricated from a 3&quot; length of 0.688&quot; X 
				1.25&quot; aluminum bar as shown in the drawing on the right.&nbsp;
				<br><br>The first step was to mill the sides to form the 0.433&quot; 
				part as shown in the drawing above.&nbsp; <br><br>Next, the holes shown in red 
				on the right were drilled.&nbsp; 
				Some of these holes remove material where slots will be milled.&nbsp; 
				Some of the holes are in corners of future saw cuts.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				The countersunk holes in the corners are for 1/4&quot; FH screws that will 
				secure the bar when the curved surfaces are machined.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

		<p class="style1"><strong>Cylinder Drain:&nbsp; </strong>The plan is to 
		run the brakes off both air and steam.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steam condenses and 
		the cylinders will eventually fill with water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrangements 
		must be made to drain off the condensate to avoid freezing if the 
		locomotive is stored in an unheated place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Photo 
		above shows installation of the drain under the cylinder mount.&nbsp; (A 
		1/8&quot; NPT to 3/16&quot; -40 bushing is screwed into the supply port of the 
		cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp;This bushng was made of the NPT end of a 3/16&quot; 
		compression tube to&nbsp; 1/8&quot; NPT fitting.&nbsp; The NPT end was 
		shorted and a NPT thread die was run backwards over the treads to make 
		for a better fit in the cylinder port.&nbsp; Thread sealant will be 
		required.)&nbsp; The 3/16&quot; fittings are then connected to the 
		bushing as shown in the photo above.&nbsp; A globe valve is used as a 
		drain cock with the handle above the cylinder mount.&nbsp; Note that 
		several notches were cut in the cylinder mount for the plumbing 
		fixtures.&nbsp; Also note that the end of the globe valve was cut off 
		--- this allows the free end of the cylinder to move side-to-side to match the 
		variations in brake linkages.&nbsp;&nbsp; The air/steam supply will be 
		via 1/8&quot; hose fitted to a hose barb that will screw into the open end of 
		the tee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plumbing on the under side of the 
		cylinder mount is covered with a ~4&quot; length of 2&quot; X 1/2&quot; X 1/8&quot; channel 
		attached with four 6-32 screws and nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

		<p class="style1">Photo above shows all the brake components for the

		plumbing has been installed in this photo.&nbsp; The handle of the drain 
		valve can be accessed by reaching under the frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
