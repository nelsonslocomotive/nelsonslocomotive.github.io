		<p class="style1">Photo above shows the top view of the truck at this 
		stage.&nbsp; This is the tender truck (outer truck gearing and no axel 
		pump).&nbsp; The tender truck carries the heaviest load and uses a total 
		of 8 springs --- the other two trucks use only 6 springs each. &nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The major remaining part is the Truck Bolster. </p>
		<p class="style1"><img height="325" src="Bolster.jpg" width="699"></p>
		<p class="style1"><strong>HC206 Truck Bolster Casting: </strong>The 
		photo above shows a finished <font class="style2" size="2">bolster with 
		rollers and bolster pin installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step in the 
		machining is to center the casting in the lathe 4-jaw chuck and drill 
		and bore the recess in the center.&nbsp; The bolster pin can then be 
		installed and the fit with the fame bolster checked. The pin was turned 0.01&quot; 
		undersize so that the truck bolster could rock slightly with 
		respect to the frame bolster.&nbsp; The top of the pin was marked with 
		respect to the top of the frame bolster and the end of the pin was then 
		finished for the retaining clip or pin. </font></p>
		<p class="style1">The next step was to machine the bolster sides to fit with 
		the bolster cap and to machine the ends to mate with the truck sides.&nbsp; 
		There is considerable excess material in these area so an approach of 
		sawing off most of the excess followed milling or grinding any that 
		remains is probably the quickest.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found an easy way to mill the 45 degree 
		angles was to rotate the milling vise 45 degrees and machine the sides 
		with the side of an end mill.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the trucks are set up at 
		this point with axels, sides and both the lower and upper crosses, one 
		should be able easily check the bolster and continue the machining until 
		it can slide up and down without interference (springs removed). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

		<p class="style1"><strong>HM209 Side Rod: </strong>The side rod design 
		drawing is repeated above. The initial plan was to have the rods 
		investment cast in steel.&nbsp; The foundry I'm using now doesn't cast 
		in steel so it was decided to make the rods from bar stock.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style1"><img height="370" src="SideRodB.jpg" width="696"></p>
		<p class="style1">The drawing above shows how the rods were made from 
		three pieces----- the basic rod cut from 1/4&quot; X 7/8&quot; bar stock and 
		the 
		pair of hubs turned from 7/8&quot; diameter bar stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hubs 
		were silver soldered into the rod.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last thing was to 
		drill and tap holes for the grease nipples and then to install the 
		nipples.</p>
		<p class="style1"><img height="223" src="SideRodC.JPG" width="700"></p>
		<p class="style1">Photo above shows a nearly finished rod.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The edges need to be rounded a bit and the fillets at the interface 
		between the straight and round part of the rod ends need a bit of 
		smoothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style1">This wraps up the truck construction except for the 
		truck part of the brake system which is described in the

		Construction III</a> page. </p>
