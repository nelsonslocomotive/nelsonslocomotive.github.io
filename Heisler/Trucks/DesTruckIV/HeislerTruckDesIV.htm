	  ago I purchased the brake components in above photo from Howard Gorin (<a href="http://www.themachineryworks.com/index.cfm">www.themachineryworks.com</a>) at 
	  Cabin Fever with the thought that they might be usable on the Heisler.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	  Unfortunately I forgot about them until I had finished fabricating the 
	  brakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shoe on the left is cast aluminum and shoe holder 
	  on the right is cast brass.&nbsp; The shoe is retained in the holder by 
	  the brass strip that is inserted from the top.&nbsp; This shoe is 
	  nearly an exact match to the shoe part of HM220 shoe described above.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I 
	  had it to do over I'd probably design an brass piece that could be silver
