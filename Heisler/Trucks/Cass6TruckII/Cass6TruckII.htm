      <p align="left">This is one of the most difficult drawings I've done.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I kept getting the photos backwards, etc.&nbsp; I think the model will be
      much plainer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>


      <p align="left"><b>Upper Cross Bars: </b>The upper cross bars connect between the
      top of the truck
      sides via clevises to control the
      separation of the sides.&nbsp; There is also a cross bar at the lower part
      of the truck under the bolster that has the same purpose.&nbsp;
      Together, the three bars keep the sides nearly parallel and at a nearly
      fixed distance apart.&nbsp; The control is not absolute because
      the sides&nbsp;are permitted to rotate around the axis
      of that lower cross bar to accommodate variations in the
      track.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="UpperCross1.jpg" width="599" height="154"></p>
      <p align="left">The photo above shows one of the upper cross bars
      that had been removed from the middle truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; The piece in the
      lower middle of the photo is part of one of the caps that was also on the
      floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; These bars and the clevises are both steel, not iron
      castings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left">The photo above shows one of the upper cross bars on the
      front truck.&nbsp; The studs on the clevis pass through holes in the cap
      and the side.&nbsp; The bars bow up like the bolster to allow the shaft to pass underneath.</p>

              into the base of the clevis.&nbsp;&nbsp; The studs are ~ 1&quot;
              diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp; After looking at this photo I realized that
              I didn't measure the pin OD.&nbsp; The pin is definitely bigger
              than the studs so I drew it at 1.5&quot; OD --- close enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <p>The&nbsp;drawing above describes the upper cross bar and the
      clevises.&nbsp; The dimensions have been checked against the cap and side
      drawings and they seem to fit together.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 39.5&quot; overall
      width when added to the width of the part of the cap through which the
      studs pass (2 @ 1.5&quot;) gives a total of 42.5&quot;.&nbsp; The inside
      dimension between the bolster legs is&nbsp; 43.75&quot; giving 0.25&quot;
      slack.&nbsp; There is 0.25&quot; slack in the other direction too.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Based on the roughness of the measurements, the fact that things seem to
      fit together is more due to luck than skill..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The above drawing of the lower cross bar was made primarily from the
      photos so it is only approximate.&nbsp; The diameter of the ends were measured.&nbsp; The positions of the shoulders on the end
      cylinders
      were
      computed based on the other truck drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      dimensions of the mount for the gear case swivel and the underside are
      estimates made from measuring photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the lower
      cross bar for the front and rear truck.&nbsp; The lower cross bar for the
      middle truck has the gear case swivel offset to one side as shown in a
      previous photo.</p>
      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="BrakeBoard.JPG" width="500" height="298"></p>
      <p>The above photo shows the brake plank that is between the lower cross
      bar and the inside axel on the front and rear truck.&nbsp; The plank
      serves as a mount for the brake cylinder (cylinder hangs
      underneath).&nbsp; The extra gears on the middle truck require a different
      mounting arrangement for the middle truck brake cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
      plank is not a structural part of the truck so it's covered with the brake
      components.&nbsp;</p>


      <p>This finishes up the Cass 6 trucks.&nbsp; All Cass 6 Truck drawings are
      in one file that can be downloaded from the
      <a href="../../Drawings/Drawings.htm">Drawings</a>
