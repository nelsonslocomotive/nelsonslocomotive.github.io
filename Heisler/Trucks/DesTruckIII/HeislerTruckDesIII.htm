        <p align="left" class="style5">This photo shows a lower cross mounted to the truck 
        sides.&nbsp; The swivel bearing and bearing block are still mounted.&nbsp; 
        The swivel bearing is offset so this is also a middle truck.&nbsp; Note 
        that the bearing block is retained in the slot in the lower cross by 
		straps.&nbsp;&nbsp; The straps don't tighten against block so it can slide left-to-right as 
        necessary to keep the block aligned with the gear case.&nbsp; Note the very 
        short heads on the left clamp which is under the line 
        shaft.&nbsp; Apparently there was only enough room for short bolt heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left" class="style5">
        The design of the truck bolster casting is shown in the drawing
        above.&nbsp; The design is very close to the prototype. However, the prototype 
        casting is hollow while the model is solid.&nbsp; There is a pin (HM214) from 
        the frame bolster through the truck bolster which holds the truck to the 
        frame if the locomotive rolls over.&nbsp; This pin screws into the 3/8&quot; 
		hole in the center of the bolster. The prototype seemed to have no 
        mechanism such as pins or recesses to hold the springs in position.&nbsp; 
        In this design there are tapered pins on the underside of the bolster which fit 
        into the springs to keep them aligned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The original 
		plan was to cast the roller base as part of the bolster.&nbsp; However, 
		after receiving the first castings it was decided that the rollers could 
		be positioned more accurately by making the roller base as a separate part.&nbsp; </p>

        <p class="style2">
        The photo above shows the first three truck bolster castings.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The supports for the rollers were cutoff; the roller bases were made as 
		separate units as discussed above.&nbsp; The pattern will be modified so 
		that future castings won't have the roller supports. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            pin is equipped with a grease fitting. I assume the pin is hollow 
            with a cross drilled hole near the middle of the roller.&nbsp; The 
            grease probably exits the pin and lubricates the roller-pin

		1/16/2012: </span>
		<span class="style5">The springs selected for the trucks are standard parts from 
        McMaster-Carr - #96570K24 shown in the drawing above. (This drawing was 
        downloaded from the McMaster website---- note that the number on the 
		drawing has a zero missing.) The spring rate is 138 lbs/inch.&nbsp; 
        The free length is 1.875&quot; and the fully compressed length is 1.46&quot;.&nbsp; 
        A force of&nbsp; 57 
        lbs is required to fully compress the spring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If 8 springs 
		are used, the load to bottom 
        the truck bolster is 456 
        lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If 6 springs are used,&nbsp; the load to bottom the 
		truck bolster is 342 lbs. &nbsp;&nbsp; The greatest load 
        will be on the tender.&nbsp; The tank will hold&nbsp; about 11 gallons
        of water weighing about 100 lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tender frame and tank will weigh 
        maybe 50 lbs. So, a&nbsp;180 lb engineer and a full tank of water will 
		exert a force of about&nbsp; 330 lbs which will bottom a set of six 
		springs but not a set of 8 springs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence 8 springs should 
		be used on the tender.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The load on the two tucks under 
		the engine is less so I'll start with 6 springs on the front and middle 
		trucks.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Note that the trucks 
        themselves which are a significant part of the locomotive weight are not 
        part of 
        the spring load.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
