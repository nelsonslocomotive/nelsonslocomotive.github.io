        <p align="left">The wheels are iron castings obtained from Allen Models.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The castings are a bit rough but clean up quite nicely.&nbsp; The 40&quot; 
        wheel scales to 5.33&quot;.&nbsp; The castings were intended to make a 5&quot; 
        wheel.&nbsp; The goal is to make the wheel as close to 5.33&quot; as 
        possible.&nbsp; I was able to get 5.25&quot;, which is close enough 
        considering the alternative of making my own wheel castings.&nbsp; The 
        wheel and axel design information is at
        <a href="../DesTruckI/HeislerlTruckDesI.htm">Heisler 
        Truck Design I</a>.&nbsp; I 
        started by completely machining one wheel and then doing the remaining 
        eleven wheels in assembly line fashion.&nbsp; The following describes 
        the assembly line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">

            <td width="50%"><b>Machining the back: </b>The rough casting is 
            about 1/4&quot; too thick.&nbsp; The first operation is to turn about 
            0.2&quot; off the back and to drill and bore the center hole.<p>The font 
            of the casting has the counter weight that sticks out from the tire 
            about 0.1&quot; and the base for the rod pin that sticks out a bit more.&nbsp; 
            I cut three pieces of 1/8&quot; X 1/2&quot; bar stock about 2&quot; long and placed 
            them between the tire and the face of the (reversed) chuck jaw as 
            shown on the right. This was an easy way to keep the front face 
             
            perpendicular to the turning axis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

          <tr>
            <td width="50%">The next step was to dill and bore the center hole.&nbsp; 
            I made the hole 0.750&quot;.&nbsp; It would have been best to use a 
            reamer to get it exact --- but I didn't have a reamer so there is 
            some small variation wheel to wheel.&nbsp; Will deal with that 
            later.<p>The next step was to turn the back such that the remaining 
            tire width was ~1.0&quot;&nbsp; I did this in two cuts of ~0.1&quot; each 
            running at 60 rpm. </p>
            <p>The final step was to turn the outside slightly such that the 
            back quarter inch or so is flat.&nbsp;&nbsp; The outside has a 
            considerable taper so there was no problem doing this while keeping 
            the tool from hitting the chuck jaws.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>This operation was completed on all wheels before doing the next 
            step.</td>

            reverse the wheel and turn the front.&nbsp; The tire is turned down 
            to 15/16&quot; width, the counterweight and crank pin base to 1&quot; and the 
            hub to 15/16&quot;.&nbsp; I was able to do this in one pass at 60 rpm.&nbsp; 
            The tool was set for the 15/16&quot; tire width, then moved out to 1&quot; for 
            the counterweight and crank pin base and then adjusted back to 
            15/16&quot; for the hub.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <p>The photo shows turning the counterweight and crank pin base.&nbsp; 
            This was taken before I figured out that I could do the front in one

            <td width="50%"><b>Fixture: </b>Proper quartering will be insured by 
            making the keyways at each end of each axel exactly 90 degrees apart and 
            making the position of the of the crank pin relative to the keyway  
            identical for all wheels.&nbsp; The simple fixture shown on the 
            right insures the wheel keyway-crankpin relationship.&nbsp; The 
            fixture is a piece of 1/2&quot; X 1.25&quot; aluminum bar stock and a 3/4&quot; 
            keyway broach bushing for the 3/16&quot; keyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; The small hole is 
            3/16&quot; and offset from the bushing center by 1.875&quot;.&nbsp; 
            The keyway is 
            aligned with the smaller hole ---- it doesn't have to be exact since 
            the requirement is that all wheels be identical.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            The surface of the fixture under the small hole is recessed 1/16&quot; to match with the 
            wheel crankpin base that extends 1/16&quot; beyond the hub.</td>

            shank center drill run though the small hole to mark the location of 
            the crank pin.&nbsp; The fixture&nbsp; is then removed and the the 
            mark used to drill a 3/16&quot; hole about 1/2&quot; deep --- this is a pilot 
            hole for the crankpin.&nbsp; The fixture is then put back on the 
            wheel and a 3/16&quot; pin inserted through the fixture into the hole in 
            the wheel as shown on the right.&nbsp; This keeps everything aligned for 
            the next step of broaching the keyway.&nbsp; </td>

            CFS with a 3/16&quot; X 3/32&quot; keyway and a 3/8&quot;-24 hole tapped in the 
            end. The outside was turned down slightly (~.001&quot;)&nbsp; to make 
            the wheels a sliding fit.&nbsp; The mandrel sticks out less than the 
            wheel hub width so that the bolt forces the wheel against the collet 
            face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

            The cross slide was set for a 2 degree taper. The tire was turned in 
            two passes at 60 rpm.<p>After all the tires were turned, each was 
            mounted on the mandrel again, the flange turned to the correct 
            diameter and then a course file used to round the 
            flange and the front edge of the tire. </td>

      <p align="left"><b>Finishing the wheel: </b>Many of the wheels had  extra 
      material around some of the spokes next to the hub or the tire. In many 
      cases the material was coarse and crusty.&nbsp; I used the Dremel and some 
      inexpensive diamond cutters (points)&nbsp;from Harbor Freight to clean up these 
      areas and also to round the inner edges of the counterweight and crank pin 
      base.&nbsp; About 10 or 15 minutes per wheel did the trick.&nbsp; This was the 
      first real test of the battery powered Dremel.&nbsp; Don't know how I ever got 
      along without it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left">Once the wheels were finished I completely cleaned the 
      workshop to get rid of the iron dust and chips that the cat was dragging 
      to other parts of the house.&nbsp; (I later learned that residue from my 
      jeans stained the inside of the washing machine.&nbsp; Someone is very 
      unhappy.)&nbsp; </p>
