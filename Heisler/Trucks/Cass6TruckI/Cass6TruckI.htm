      <p align="left">The individual parts of the Heisler trucks are difficult
        to photograph because they are hidden by other parts of the locomotive
      as well as the gears inside the truck.&nbsp; Without the good fortune of
        finding the middle truck off the locomotive and partially disassembled
        on a photo trips in June and July, 2004 I doubt if I would have ever figured out
      the shape of
        some of the castings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trucks are
      complex so I've split the description into two parts to keep the download
      time reasonable while presenting many photos.&nbsp; The sides and bolster
      are discussed in this first part with the remainder of the components
      presented in Part II.&nbsp; The wheels, rods, gears and brakes are
      described elsewhere.</p>

              truck looking front to back..&nbsp; The side
              is a large
              casting.&nbsp; It looks like sleeve bearings are used on the
              axels.&nbsp;&nbsp; The little cover on the top edge directly above
              the axel provides access to a bearing oil reservoir.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              bearing that is part of the gear case.&nbsp; I'm lifting the cover
              for the axel bearing oil reserve in the hollow part of the side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The blue stuff I
              think is
              called waste and is used to control the oil feed to the
              bearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

              bottom of the frame bolster resting on the bottom of the
              cavity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rollers at the ends of the bolster prevent
              the frame from tipping to the side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bolster is

      <p>The drawing above shows the truck bolster.&nbsp; No attempt was made to
      show the interior cavities.&nbsp; I've shown more dimensions that usual on
      this piece to assure myself that the pieces fit together.&nbsp; For
      example, the bolster must fit with the sides, the caps and also match up
      with the frame bolster. And, the&nbsp; bolster must position the frame at
      the correct height.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
