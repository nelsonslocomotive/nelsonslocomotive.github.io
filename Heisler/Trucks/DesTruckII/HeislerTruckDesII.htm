      truck side casting and to show that the axel bearing cap and lower cross 
      cap will be machined from bar stock instead of cast as originally planned.

      <p align="left">
      <span class="style4">The main truck side casting, axel bearing cap and&nbsp; cross piece 
      retainer are the subject of this part.&nbsp; 
      Before starting the design of the truck sides the 
      following photos of disassembled trucks were reviewed.

        <p align="left" class="style4">The partially disassembled truck above has the truck 
        bolster and the upper cross pieces which hold the truck sides in place.&nbsp; 
        This is a later truck design which has a much simpler upper cross pieces 
        than used on Cass 6.&nbsp; The brake plank which holds the brake 
        cylinder is used only on the outside trucks.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4">The photo above gives a clearer views of the inside of 
        the truck side casting.&nbsp; This is a middle truck where the brake 
        cylinder is attached to truck side by the bracket identified on the 
        drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brake cylinder is barely visible in the weeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The lower cross piece is still installed on this truck.&nbsp; The  
        bearing for the gearbox swivel on the lower cross piece is off 
        center, another clue that it is the middle truck where the gear case and 
        pinion shaft are off center to one side to make room for the line shaft 
        on the other side.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style4">The&nbsp; photo above shows a lower cross 
        piece with the shaft on the left side is broken off.&nbsp; The non symmetric 
        center indicates that it is for a middle truck.</p>

          The bolt heads are visible on several of the previous photos. </span>

          weeds before taking the photo all I can say is I tried.&nbsp; But, 
          hadn't eaten my Wheaties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That side probably weighs
