		next.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo above shows turning the ends of the lower 
		cross.&nbsp;&nbsp; The piece was rotated in the 3 jaw chuck until a spot 
		was found where the the far end was roughly centered as determined by a 
		dial indicator (that area of the casting is rough with a significant 
		parting line).&nbsp;&nbsp; There was insufficient material to make the 
		ends 5/8&quot; diameter so they were turned down to 19/32&quot; and the sleeve 
		bearing was changed from 5/8&quot; ID to 19/32&quot; ID.&nbsp; The shaft end was 
		drilled and tapped and the shoulder at the inner end was turned to the 
		correct dimensions using this same setup.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

		Outside Truck Gears and Shafts</a> section.&nbsp; The original plan was 
		to use a sleeve bearing inside of the bearing block.&nbsp; When I got 
		around to making the block I found some bronze bearing stock scraps left 
		over from making the engine rod bearings so that was used eliminating 
		the need for a separate sleeve bearing.&nbsp; The HM315 drawing has been 
		updated. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

				correct overall length.&nbsp; Six holes are then drilled in the 
				cap.&nbsp; I used the angle fixture shown in the photo on the 
				right to drill the holes. (After looking at the result I changed 
				the drawing slightly to move the holes closer to the outer 
				edge.) The main fastener for the Cap is the long 8-32 bolt shown 
				on the right side of the photo.&nbsp; The bolt was made of 
				stainless threaded rod and a 1/4&quot; hex nut silver soldered to one 
				end. </td>

		<p class="style1"><strong>Back to the Truck Sides:</strong> After the 
		lower cross was completed, the trucks with lower cross and axels were 
		assembled and everything checked to make sure it fit together and verify 
		that the sides were straight.&nbsp; The sides were then removed and the 
		final machining of the sides completed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The image above 
		lists the tasks.</p>
		<p class="style1"><strong>HM206 Bearing Retainer: </strong>&nbsp;Slots 
		1/32&quot; deep by 1/2&quot; wide slots were milled in the truck side at the 
		proper location for the bearing retainer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bearing 
		retainer was used as a temple to location the holes in the truck side 
		which were then drilled and tapped for the plate attachment&nbsp; 
		screws.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style1"><strong>HM207 Upper Cross:</strong>&nbsp; The Upper 
		Crosses are&nbsp; simply lengths of 1/8&quot; X 3/8&quot; CFS bar stock with a 
		hole in each end.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ends of the bars fit into the slots 
		shown on the image above.&nbsp; This slots were milled and the cross 
		attachment holes were drilled and tapped at this time. </p>
		<p class="style1"><strong>HC207 Bolster cap Attachment Holes:&nbsp;
		</strong>The Bolster Caps machined earlier&nbsp; were clamped to the 
		truck sides and used as templates to locate the associated attachment 
		holes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The vertical hole for the 8-32 bolt is over 2.5&quot; long 
		----care must be taken to make sure the side is held vertical in the 
		drill press and the drill pulled out often to clear chips.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Drilling a short hole and tapping it requires less effort but has the 
		risk that the attachment screw becomes rusted in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style1"><strong>Slots for the Brake Shoe Hangers:</strong>&nbsp; 
		These 1/4&quot; wide slots were cut using a Woodruff Key Slot cutter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The truck sides were clamped in the milling vise with the side facing up 
		for this operation.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style1">Holes for Brake Shoe Hanger Pins:&nbsp; I made a 
		fixture to locate these holes but have misplaced it so no photo.&nbsp; 
		The fixture has a slot that fits over the bars on the side of the 
		casting.&nbsp; The holes for the pins were drilled all the way through 
		the casting so that a pin rusted in place can be driven out from the 
		inside. Long pins are used to reduced the probability the casting 
		will break if the brakes grab.</p>

				<td><strong>Axel Pump Bracket:</strong> The truck side next to 
				the axel pump requires an additional bracket as shown in the

				piece of aluminum angle (steel, brass or bronze could also be 
				used).&nbsp; The bracket must be made and located to match the 
				specific pump.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
