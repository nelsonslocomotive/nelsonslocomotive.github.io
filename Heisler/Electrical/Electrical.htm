        &nbsp;<span class="style2">The electrical system on the Shay was an 
		afterthought.&nbsp; This time&nbsp; I planned ahead; a 3&quot; 
		high space under the oil tank was reserved for an electrical 
		compartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="style5">

		<p class="style3">
        The diagram above shows the position of the electrical compartment.&nbsp; 
		There is also a bulge in front of the oil tank that serves as an open 
		space to run air hoses and wires to the top where the switches and brake 
		valve are located.&nbsp; The front of the bulge is roughly in line with 
		the cab doors when they are open so it shouldn't effect the aesthetics 
		too much.&nbsp;&nbsp; The location of the switches and controls in not 
		prototypical but I'm getting too old to bend over and fumble to find 
		controls down inside the cab. &nbsp;The throttle lever will also be located 
		in the area of the switches. </p>
		<p class="style3">
        The oil tank on the later Heislers was connected to the side of the 
		metal cab.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cab and oil tank haven't been designed yet 
		but the plan is to make them as one unit that is easy to lift off to 
		access the electrical compartment as well as the plumbing for the air, 
		water and fuel systems that run under the cab floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		only connection between the cab-oil tank unit and the rest of the 
		locomotive is the oil feed line.&nbsp; The oil line will run vertically 
		out of the the right rear of the tank to an angle shutoff valve just 
		below the top of the frame.&nbsp; The valve will be hard connected to 
		the tank.&nbsp; The valve handle will be on the bottom of the valve and 
		easily accessed from under the side of the frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; The output 
		of the valve will be horizontal toward the front and equipped with a 
		coolant quick connect which feeds into the fuel filter.&nbsp; The valve 
		and quick connect should permit easy removal of the filter for cleaning 
		and also easy removal of the tank-cab unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="style3">
        The electrical compartment will contain a 12 volt ~ 
		20 amp hour sealed lead acid battery, the igniter circuitry, an 
		electric water pump that will supplement the axel pump and an electric 
		air compressor that will supplement the steamed power air compressor for 
		the brakes.&nbsp; The main power switch will be located near the fuel 
		shutoff valve and operated by reaching under the cab.&nbsp; All other switches will be located on the 
		top of the bulge described previously.&nbsp; </p>
