        The photo above shows the headlamp and generator on MRSR91.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The headlamp is similar to the pair I made for the Shay&nbsp; (see
		<a href="../../../Shay/Electrical/ElectricalII/ElectricalII.htm">Shay Electrical II)</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I hadn't used the headlamp mounted on the Shay tender for years and was 
		planning to remove it as part of an update to install a swivel seat like 
		on the Heisler.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I just decided to use that Shay tender 
		headlamp on the front of the Heisler.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        I purchased a kit to make a non working generator several years ago.&nbsp; 
		Luckily I was able to find it for this project.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I 
		purchased it from Wayne Godshall.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a mounting for both 
		the generator and the headlamp similar to that used on MRSR91; see 
		following photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        I used a 20 ohm resistance in series with the LED to limit the current 
		from the 12 volt battery to about 400 miliamperes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I only 
		used it once at night and it is very bright; possibly too bright.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I turned it off when approaching other locomotives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe 
		I'll put in a dimmer arrangement next year. </p>

				276-0005.&nbsp; The LED is housed in the mounting shown on the

				The electrical current runs from the 12 volt battery through the
