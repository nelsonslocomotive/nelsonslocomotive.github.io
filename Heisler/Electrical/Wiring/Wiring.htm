        The diagram above shows the wiring.&nbsp;&nbsp; The power supply 
		(battery, charger connector and charge indicator ) is on the left, the 
		distribution terminals in the middle and the loads on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The 12 volt system is not a shock hazard.&nbsp; However, the battery 
		can supply considerable power through the high current capacity so large 
		size wire is required (10 to 12 gauge for the 25A circuit, 12-14 gauge 
		for the 15 amp circuits and 16-18 gauge or the lower current circuits).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Note that all the circuits are fused. This is to prevent the wires from 
		melting in case of a short circuit (best keep the fire in the fire box).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The subsystems are individually fused so that a short can be 
		isolated to a subsystem. </p>

		<a href="../../Brakes/BrakeValve/BrakeValve.htm">Brake 
		Valve</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The black lines connecting the brake valve are 
		Clippard 1/8&quot; ID hose. &nbsp; That is the power terminal strip below the

        <strong>Battery Charge Indicator: </strong>&nbsp;The charge indicator

		indicator.&nbsp; This area is normally dark so the LEDs will be easy to

        <strong>Igniter:</strong> The igniter is shown above.&nbsp; It was 
		desired that the igniter be removable as a unit for test and repair so all 
		the parts were mounted to a chassis.&nbsp; The chassis is this case is a 
		7&quot; length of 2&quot; X 2&quot; X 1/8&quot; angle.&nbsp; The coil 
		was secured to the 
		angle with RTV.&nbsp; The aluminum angle with the relays was secured to 
		the chassis angle with a single screw.&nbsp;&nbsp; This orientation of 
		the relays keeps most of the wiring below the relays and protected.&nbsp; 
		The large power resistors were secured to the coil with RTV and the wire 
		leads covered with heat shrink tubing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The steel angle is 
		secured to the floor plate with a couple screws.&nbsp; The red wire is 
		the power lead and the yellow wire is the control lead that connects to 
		the push button switch.
        &nbsp;&nbsp; A 20&quot; spark plug wire with boots was purchased at the auto 
		parts store.&nbsp; The boot at the coil end was removed, the wire cut to 
		the correct length and the crimp end reattached.&nbsp; The boot that was at 
		the coil end was discarded.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        The photo above shows the igniter installed between the battery and the

		wire from the red pushbutton switch. (The blue wire to the the black 
		pushbutton switch goes to the water pump relay.&nbsp; The green wire is 
		from the toggle switch and will connect to the air compressor relay.)&nbsp; 
		The dark charcoal colored spark plug wire is visible on the right --- it

		sparkplug.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <strong>Air Compressor:</strong> The air compressor was not part of the 
		original design -- the original plan was to use steam as a backup if the 
		steam powered air compressor failed.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the&nbsp; 
		electrical compartment was being laid out using the actual water pump, 
		battery and igniter components it&nbsp;was discovered that there was room 
		for a small compressor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The compressor is a Harbor Freight 
		item #96068 that has been modified to fit in the available space --- see 
		<a href="../../Brakes/ElecAirComp/ElecAirComp.htm">Electric Air Compresso</a>r page in Brakes section.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		compressor is clamped to a small 1/8&quot; steel plate which is attached to&nbsp; 
		the right fame channel with a couple screws.&nbsp;&nbsp; The control 
		relay and the pressure switch are&nbsp; mounted to the under side of the 
		steel plate.&nbsp; </p>

        This is the rear view of the electrical compartment with everything

		the air compressor ---- between the right frame channel the frame side 
		to the bottom of the oil tank.&nbsp; There is shutoff valve on the lower 
		end of the oil line and a quick connect&nbsp; on the output side of the 
		shutoff.&nbsp; The oil filter connects to the valve via the quick 
		connect.&nbsp; The oil tank can be removed by closing the shutoff valve, 
		disconnecting the oil filter and then lifting the tank off. </p>
