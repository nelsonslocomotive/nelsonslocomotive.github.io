      winter&nbsp;&nbsp; ------- start a model of of a large 3 truck
      Heisler.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been interested in the Heislers for years and started
      a&nbsp; 1/4&quot; scale model in the 1970s.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a set of
      drawings and castings like available from&nbsp; Ken Schroeder for the
      shay are not available for the Heisler.&nbsp; Allen Models sells a
      wheel casting that is a good match.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm pretty much on my own for
      the the rest of the parts and drawings.&nbsp; However, I do have some resources:</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>West Coast Special:&nbsp; </b>Heisler introduced the
      West Coast Special design to compete with Lima's Pacific Coast Shay.&nbsp;
      The major design change was the use of piston valves and a
      superheater.&nbsp; Climax also switched to Piston Valves at about the same
      time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial">Potlatch #92 has the piston valves and
      super heater so I had assumed that the design change was made in
      1924.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Kline's text indicates that s/n 1555, built in December
      1927, was the first West Coast Special.&nbsp;&nbsp; The early West Coast Specials
      had the steam input on the boiler side of
      the valve area and used outside admission. A short time later (months or maybe a year) the
      design was changed to inside admission with the steam entering at the front side of the valve
      area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Potlatch #92 has the steam entering the front side so the engine was
      manufactured after 1927.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p align="left"> 
        <font face="Arial">Kline
      shows two photos of Ohio Match No 4 (s/n 1488), a 50 ton Class B built in 1923.&nbsp;
      The first photo shows slide valves and the second photo, taken some time
      later,&nbsp; shows piston valves and super heater.&nbsp; The caption
      says that 1488&nbsp; was converted to the later design some years
      after manufacture.&nbsp; The caption also mentions that
      Ohio Match converted a 90 ton Heisler from slide valves to piston valves and super
      heater.&nbsp; Potlatch #92 (s/n 1502) started life as Ohio Match #1.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      There are two photos of 1502 at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.camasprairierails.com/Potlatch_locomotives.htm">http://www.camasprairierails.com/Potlatch_locomotives.htm</a>,
      one is a builder's photo showing the slide valve design and the other
      photo showing piston valves and superheater.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems clear
      that 1502 was updated with a new boiler and engine in 1928 or
      later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial">After 1502 was updated, someone had a
      spare engine and boiler manufactured in 1924.&nbsp; Recall that Cass 6 was
      manufactured in 1929, using obsolete parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The original Cass 6 boiler is stamped with a manufacture date of 1924
      (photo on <a href="Boiler&Burner/Cass6Boiler/Cass6Boiler.htm">Cass 6 Boiler</a> 
        page).&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if the original engine and boiler from 1502 
        ended up in 1591.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Doug Edwards sent the following in response to my 
        speculation above.&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;<i>From what I understand from<br>
        the old timers here, the loco was upgraded here.&nbsp; The power unit changes 
        were likely done without removing the main castings from the frame.&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;From what I have gathered from long gone interested parties, I suspect 
        the boiler was not replaced, but rebuilt with new fluesheets to 
        accommodate the superheaters.&nbsp; There were shops at that time in Spokane 
        that were capable of performing the needed changes.&nbsp; I tend to doubt 
        that the boiler was removed and a new one shipped out from Erie.&nbsp; It 
        would have been much cheaper to just rebuild to the needed 
        configuration.&nbsp; The GN shops in Hillyard built new huge 2-8-8-2's, so 
        changing the fluesheets would not have been a problem for their shop.&nbsp; 
        The loco operated not far from me here in No. Idaho, and would have been 
        less than 60 miles from the shops in Spokane.</i><br>

        <font face="Arial"><b>Getting started:&nbsp; </b>Accurate drawings will be needed so it was time to bite the bullet
      and get mechanical CAD software.&nbsp; Several of the free CAD programs were
      downloaded and tried.&nbsp;&nbsp; None seemed very easy to
      use.&nbsp; A trial version of TurboCAD Professional was then
      downloaded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, what a difference.&nbsp; I was able to draw a
      wheel with spokes in an evening&nbsp; --- I had spent probably 20 hours trying
      to draw the wheel on the other trial versions with little success.&nbsp; Unfortunately,&nbsp;
      the TurboCAD professional V10 lists for over $500.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have a
      cheaper version ----- TurboCAD Deluxe V10 that lists for ~$150 but there
      are no detailed specifications on the TurboCAD website that explains the
      differences between the two.&nbsp; I was able to find a retail website
      that listed the features of each side by side.&nbsp; It seems that the
      Deluxe version has all the features that I want and I don't understand most the features available only in the Professional
      version.&nbsp; A CD with TurboCAD Deluxe V10 and a 1&quot; thick reference manual was purchased on
      line for $99 plus shipping.&nbsp; The&nbsp; software loaded with no
      problem and it ran just like the trial professional version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The initial plan was to&nbsp; model Cass 6 - 1591.&nbsp;
      However, after the documentation on 1591 was nearly completed, I became
      interested in the later piston valve design of the &quot;West Coast
      Specials&quot;&nbsp; and
      began to consider modeling MRSR 91 - 1595.&nbsp; After examining 1595 I made
      the decision to model it.&nbsp; As far as I can tell 1591 and 1595 are
      identical with the following exceptions</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">1595 has an oil burner whereas 1591 burns coal..</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">1595 has the later all weather cab.</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">A double set of frame front stiffening plates are used
          on 1595.</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Slotted castings are used in place of frame rear
          stiffening plates on 1595.&nbsp;</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">A different design&nbsp; eccentric strap and eccentric
          rods are used on 1595.</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Much simpler truck upper cross bars are used on 1595. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial"> <b>Reference Data:</b>&nbsp; I&nbsp; much prefer to
      refine the data and document it as I go along --- I am unwilling to go
      back and document something I did months ago --- even if I could remember
      something from months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the plan is to present photos, measurements
      and drawings of Cass 6 first.&nbsp; This will be an iterative
      process consisting of taking photos and measurements, documenting with
      photos, text and drawings and then verifying the accuracy on subsequent
      visits and revising the data as necessary.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
      part is essentially complete.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial">Next, the specific parts of MRSR 91 that I found different
      from Cass 6 will be documented.&nbsp;&nbsp; This step is also essentially
      complete.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial"> <b>Model Design:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The next step is the 
      design of the model&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The model will be 1.6&quot; per foot 
      scale and 7.5&quot; gauge.&nbsp; At this time (July 2006) the majority 
      of the main locomotive design is complete. &nbsp; The current design focus is the cab followed by the tanks 
      and then the brakes.&nbsp; The sketch below shows the current state of the 
      overall locomotive design.&nbsp; Both the locomotive and tender are about 
      2&quot; longer than exact scale.&nbsp;&nbsp; The longer tender permits a 
      greater water capacity and the longer locomotive permits a larger firebox 
      and a bit more room around the engine (motor).&nbsp; </font> </p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Model Construction:&nbsp; </b>The construction will 
      parallel the completion of the design.&nbsp; This part is the major focus 
      in the summer of 2006. </font> </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Heisler should be much easier than the Shay (or Climax) to
      model.&nbsp; One of the main differences is in the trucks where the side
      frames are fairly plan and hidden by the wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the
      engine has less than half the parts.&nbsp; After a brief review
      of all the major components it was concluded that&nbsp; the wheels should
      be cast and everything else could be made from stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that Hiraoka builds his entire Heisler from stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Another very useful reference is Bob Reedy's series on Building the
      Three-Truck Climax in <u>Live Steam</u>,&nbsp; beginning in the the
      September - October 2001 issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reedy builds his Climax
      from stock except for the wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp; He purchased wheel&nbsp; castings from Ken
      Schroeder --- they look just like Ken's shay wheel castings.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Shortly after starting this project I 
      was contacted by an investment casting mold maker who was 
      interested in making live steam locomotive castings.&nbsp; After several 
      discussions we decided to pool resources and make a set of molds for 
      Heisler castings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, this mold maker's eyesight 
      failed and he was unable to complete the project.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I had to start 
      over.&nbsp; One piece of good news is that I found a pattern maker who is 
      able to use some of the investment casting patterns in patterns for sand 
      casting molds.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>
