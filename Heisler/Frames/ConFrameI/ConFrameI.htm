      <p align="left">It was the spring of 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp; The miscellaneous engine parts had all been fabricated 
      and the boiler was being made so the next thing was to finish the frame design 
      and construction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Five weeks volunteer teaching in Central 
      America where there would be a lot of free time to work 
      on the frame design was coming up in two couple weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; 
      design and fabrication of those slotted stiffeners that distinguish the 
      late Heislers filled those two weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        

      <p align="left"><b>Center Stiffener:&nbsp; </b>The design of the stiffener 
      is documented in the <a href="../DesMainFrameII/HeislerFrameDesignII.htm">
      Frame Design II </a>page (done after the stiffener was actually built).&nbsp; 
      The stiffener is too complex to machine as one piece.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, 
      after a bit of thought it became obvious that&nbsp;it could be 
      build by soldering together a bunch of relatively simple parts.&nbsp; If the part is small and 
      requires a lot of machining, brass or bronze is a good choice.&nbsp; For 
      larger parts, steel is cheaper and hence preferred unless considerable 
      machining is required.&nbsp; Kozo Hiraoka is an expert at the 
      technique of modeling castings by silver soldering together smaller 
      pieces.&nbsp; Many of his techniques have been used to make these and other 
      parts for both the Shay and the Heisler.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        

      <p align="left">For this center stiffener, not much intricate machining is 
      required so steel was the choice.&nbsp; (It also helped that all the 
      required maternal was on hand.)&nbsp; </p>

            the effort to round them to make the stiffener resemble a casting.&nbsp; </td>

            <td width="50%">Two stiffeners are required. The back&nbsp; plates 
            can be cut in one operation to minimize the effort.&nbsp; The photo 
            shows&nbsp; milling those slots in the pair of back plates.&nbsp; 
            The plates were sawed from a larger sheet and the top and bottom 
            milled smooth with the height exactly 5.437&quot;.&nbsp; The length was 
            left about 1/2&quot; too long.&nbsp; The two plates were bolted together 
            with a couple 4-40 screws on the one end.&nbsp; The other end was 
            held together with a clamp.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 1/2&quot; starter hole was drilled near 
            the end of each slot.&nbsp; A 5/8&quot; mill was then used to cut the 
            slot in both sheets using one pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cutting was slow and 
            a bit of lubricant was used.&nbsp; The chips are like little needles that 
            took a few weeks to dig out of my hands.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mill X-Y table helped to make the slots 
            fairly accurate. </td>

            One 2-56 FH brass screw per slot was used to attach the bars.&nbsp; 
            The bars and plates were accurately positioned and clamped and then 
            a trap drill run through both pieces at the same time.&nbsp; The 
            clearance drill and countersink were later used on the back plate.&nbsp; 
            <p>A center punch was used to make prick holes on the mating area 
            of the pieces to give a slight separation for solder to flow into.&nbsp; 
            The pieces were then pickled and flux applied to the joints.&nbsp; 
            The photo shows soldering the bars to the plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;A half 
            dozen&nbsp; small 
            pieces of solder was laid at the joint between the bar and the plate

        <p><b>Modified Stiffeners:</b> The basic center stiffener design was 
        later modified with the addition of a bar (HM419) along the bottom that 
        interfaces with the center boiler support.&nbsp; This modification is 
        described in the <a href="../DesMainFrameIII">Frame Design III</a> page.&nbsp;The 
        bars are lengths of 3/8&quot; X 1/2&quot; bar stock&nbsp; The recesses were rough 
        cut on the band saw and finished on the mill.&nbsp; The lower 1/2&quot; of 
        three of the vertical bars were rough cut out using a rotary tool 
        abrasive disk and then finished on the mill.&nbsp; A&nbsp; #2 FH screw into 
        the bar from the back holds the bar in position while it is silver 
        soldered to the rest of the assembly. This time short strips of .004&quot; 
        thick flat 
        silver solder and flux were sandwiched between the bars the the rest of the assembly 
        and then the assembly heated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The photo below shows the two stiffeners after the modification.
        <img border="0" src="FinishedStiffeners.jpg" width="700" height="409"></p>
        <p>Note that the stiffeners are no longer identical since the added bar 
        is off center.&nbsp; The left stiffener is on the left in the photo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The left stiffener will require further modification to accommodate the 
        reversing bar rollers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right stiffener will be 
        modified to accommodate the lubricator.&nbsp;&nbsp; The holes to attach 
        the stiffeners to the frame side and to attach the center boiler support 
        to the stiffeners must also be drilled.&nbsp; Those 
        issues will be dealt with later. </p>
