            front coupler pocket before making the front coupler support so it 
            was next.&nbsp; As mentioned in the design pages, the same pocket is 
            used on the locomotive front and the tender rear.&nbsp; The pockets 
            were machined from aluminum.<p>The first step was to make the two 
            blocks to the correct dimensions (2.625&quot; X 2.25&quot; X1&quot;).&nbsp; I sawed 
            the bocks from larger bar stock and squared and machined the blocks 
            to the exact dimensions on the mill.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step was 
            to drill out the slots with a 11/32&quot; drill and then finish with a 
            3/8&quot; mill and then a 3/16&quot; mill to square up the corners.&nbsp; The 
            photo shows the blocks&nbsp; after the slots were finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            material for later machining of fillets on each side.&nbsp; The 
            photo shows machining one of the recesses.&nbsp; Once the mill is 
            setup, the four sides can be machined with the same settings.</td>

            <td width="50%">The next step was to use a 3/32&quot; radius corner 
            rounding mill on the front sides edges as shown in the photo. A&nbsp; 
            1/8&quot; radius corner rounding mill was then used on the corners of the 
            back plate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last step was to drill the 1/4&quot; hole for 
            the pin.&nbsp; I drilled the hole from one side on the first pocket and 
            found the drill wondered to one side at the bottom.&nbsp; On the 
            second pocket I drilled a slightly under size hole half way from 
            each side and then finished the hole with the 1/4&quot; reamer from one 
            side.&nbsp;
            <p>The final finishing was done with sand paper, a small sanding 
            drum on the rotary tool and a small file.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rotary 
            tool sanding drum was used to rough in the front curvature and to 
            round the back side of the protruding part of the sides.&nbsp; These 
            were then finished with sandpaper.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
