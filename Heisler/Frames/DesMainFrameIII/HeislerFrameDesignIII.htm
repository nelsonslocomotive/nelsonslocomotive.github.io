      <p align="left"><b>Front Sill &amp; Associated Parts:&nbsp; </b>The photo 
      above shows the front sill on Cass 6.&nbsp; While preparing this 
      design I reviewed the photos of Cass 6, MRSR91 and parts from a slightly 
      smaller late Heisler.&nbsp;&nbsp; The drawings I did for Cass 6 show both 
      the locomotive front sill and the tender rear sill are 10&quot; X 13&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The review of the photos confirmed that tender sill as 10&quot; X 13&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The locomotive sill was also measured as 10&quot; thick.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; 
      the height was measured as 14.5&quot; at the center and 13.5&quot; at the ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The photo above shows the bottom of the sill is flat between the 
      vertical foot board supports and slopes up slightly toward the ends.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      I never noticed that before!&nbsp;&nbsp; All the photos and drawings of 
      other Heisler Locomotives suggest the sills did not have tapered ends.&nbsp;&nbsp; Possibly the tapered ends were done when the sill was 
      replaced a couple yeas ago.&nbsp; I decided to make the model locomotive 
      and tender sills identical at 1.375&quot; X 1.875&quot; X 16&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Hopefully I'll be able to find a suitable piece of maple or cherry. </p>

            March/April 2002) I changed my mind and decided to machine a pocket 
            like the prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pocket design is shown on the 
            right.&nbsp; It will be machined from a block of aluminum.&nbsp; 
            <p>The plan is to machine the coupler shaft so that it is split and

      <p align="left"><b>Boiler Supports:&nbsp; </b>The photo above shows the 
      rear boiler support on a late Heisler.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The end pieces are 
      castings and the cross piece is a steel bar.&nbsp; The dangling thing in 
      the center is a piece of wire.&nbsp; The photo has been edited to white 
      out background clutter around the support to make to show up better.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The bottom of the boiler (mud ring) sets on the castings.&nbsp; 
      The bar probably keeps the castings from twisting under load and also holds 
      the dimension between the frame sides.&nbsp; The rear support is hidden 
      under the cab so this piece on the model can be made a bit simpler.&nbsp; The outside of 
      the castings are visible on the front mount as well as mounting facilities 
      on the center stiffener that I'll want to reproduce on the model.&nbsp; 
      The cross bar will interfere with the oil burner nozzle so it'll have to 
      be repositioned slightly.</p>


      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="Rear%20BoilerSupport.jpg" width="600" height="350"></p>


        <p><b>Rear Boiler Support:</b>&nbsp; The rear boiler 
            support is made from a piece of 1.75&quot; X 1.5&quot; X 3/16&quot; angle.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            I'll probably have to buy 2&quot; angle and cut it down.&nbsp; The 
            support bolts to the bottom of the lower frame bar just in front of 
            the rear stiffening plate. The bar will be positioned such that 
            there is a 1/4&quot; gap between the vertical side and the back of the 
            boiler.&nbsp; The boiler will be bolted to the saddle so any 
            expansion will cause the back of the boiler to move to the rear.&nbsp; 
            I expect at most 1/16&quot; of movement between hot and cold.&nbsp;
        </p>
            <p>The top of the vertical part of the support also serves as a 
            support for the cab floor.&nbsp; The rear of he boiler doesn't 
            seemed to be clamped down on the prototype.&nbsp; For the model, I 
            plan to screw a couple 1/4&quot; bolts into the back of the mud ring and 
            run the bolts through holes in the vertical part of the support. The 
            bolts will extend beyond the support and not be tightened against 
            the support.&nbsp;&nbsp; This arrangement will permit the boiler to 
            move back and forth slightly to accommodate expansion and 
            contraction but will restrain the boiler from moving side to side or 
            to lift off the support vertically.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
            <p>This boiler support is also a brace for the side channels.&nbsp; 
            The ends fit under the channels.&nbsp; There will be a 1/16&quot; gap 
            between the boiler support and the channels which will be filled 
            with suitable shims.&nbsp; Screws up through the support into the 
            channel flanges will secure everything.

            end so that it can bolt to the under side of the lower frame bars.&nbsp; 
            A much smaller anger is used at the front than the back to avoid 
            interference with the burner nozzle and the blow down valve.&nbsp; 
            The bottom front 1/4&quot; of the boiler will rest on the angle.&nbsp; 
            However, the major front support will be via the side supports&nbsp; 
            described next.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; primary function of this

            the lower part of three of the vertical bars and silver soldering on 
            the machined bar shown in blue.&nbsp; Note that the bar is 
            positioned off

            rather than identical.&nbsp; The Boiler Side Support shown in red is 
            made to closely resemble the standard Heisler front boiler support.&nbsp; 
            The cross bar is not used because it would interfere with the burner nozzle.&nbsp; The HM416 Front Boiler Support replaces that cross
