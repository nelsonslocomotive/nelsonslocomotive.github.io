      <p align="left">Note:&nbsp; The initial plan was to present the Cass 6
      Frame on one webpage.&nbsp; However, after taking more photos and
      measurements I decided to provide a frame overview and details on the
      sides in Part I and&nbsp; describe the remaining details in Parts
      II &amp; III</p>


        <p align="left">The Heisler (excepting the early production) used a
        unique frame side members each made of two square steel bars with
        stiffening plates.&nbsp;&nbsp; This frame was called the &quot;Diamond
        Frame&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next photo shows the left side of Cass 6
        with the cab removed.&nbsp; The lower bar bends down between the trucks,
        probably to lower the position of the engine.&nbsp; The lower bar is symmetrical
        with the&nbsp; truck centerlines.&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper bar is not symmetrical
        with the trucks; on the front truck it starts to bend up in front of the rear wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
        the rear truck, the bar starts to bend up at the same point the lower bar starts to bend
        down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      attachment to the frame.</p>


      <p align="left"><img border="0" src="Frame2.jpg" width="720" height="467"></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;The next photo shows the front
      sill.&nbsp; The sill arrangement is similar to that of the Shays -----
      except that the frame sides are symmetrical to the locomotive
      centerline.&nbsp; </p>

              lower
              frame bar ends at the sill and the upper bar extends about 2/3&nbsp;
              the way across the top of the sill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      unusual shape of the link to the tender.&nbsp; The droop is necessary to
      make the tender level.&nbsp;&nbsp;That chamber in the rear of the coal bunker is
      empty; it may provide access to the pin retaining the coupler link. </p>

              casting. &nbsp; This photo and the first two were taken in the spring
              of 2003 just after the new boiler had been installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The other photos were taken in June 2004 after the overhaul had
              been finished and everything painted.</td>

              plates are used here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The holes were made&nbsp; with a touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              I initially speculated that the holes were for cooling.&nbsp; Mike
              Getscher emailed suggesting that the holes were made to peen&nbsp;
              over the ends of stay bolts that were replaced during a boiler
              refurbishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the next trip I looked and
              found that the holes lined up exactly with the stay bolts.&nbsp; I
              meant to ask the Cass Shop foreman about it but got side
              tracked.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a new boiler so the stay bolt
              locations must exactly match the old boiler.&nbsp;&nbsp; A frame
              drawing in Kline's <u>The Heisler Locomotive</u>&nbsp; seems to
              show cast plates with vertical slots the entire height ---- maybe
              to access the stay bolts.</td>
