      rear shows the rear part of a Heisler frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a much
      lighter locomotive than Cass 6 and some of the castings differ
      considerably from those of Cass 6, but the basic configuration is the
      similar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              bars.&nbsp; As a result, the sides are 4 inches shorter&nbsp; and there are 8 instead of 13 bolts securing each
