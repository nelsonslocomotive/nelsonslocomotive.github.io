            <td width="50%"><font face="Arial">The photo above shows the lower half of the MRSR91 
            tender.&nbsp; The plan is to make the model tender look like this 
            tender with the exception that the model will be about 10% longer 
            and the tank about 10% higher.&nbsp; The prototype had a wood deck 
            between the tank and deck.&nbsp; I plan to use a 1/8&quot; steel plate 
            deck. </font>
            <p><font face="Arial">The photo at right shows the underside of a late Heisler tender 
            frame.&nbsp; The major pieces are the two side castings, the bolster 
            and the two coupler support castings.&nbsp; The coupler supports 
            bolt to the bolster in the center and the wood sills at the ends.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            I plan to use a steel bar on the ends to connect the ends of the 
            sides and the supports similar to the front sill bracket design on 
            the locomotive.&nbsp; The&nbsp; frame bolster on the prototype is 
            the same as used on the locomotive whereas a slightly different 
            bolster than the locomotive will be used on the model tender.&nbsp;&nbsp; All 
            parts will be fabricated from steel plate, bar and angle stock</font></td>

      <font face="Arial">
      <b>Tender Frame Side:</b> The drawing above shows the design of the tender 
      frame side.&nbsp; The two sides are identical except for the position of 
      the holes for the bolster; the bolster is positioned slightly to the rear 
      of the tender middle.&nbsp; The holes to attach&nbsp; to the bolster must 
      match up with the mating holes shown on the bolster drawing.&nbsp; The 
      sketch of the entire frame at the end of this page shows the position of 
      the bolster in relation to the sides.&nbsp; Note that these sides are very 
      different than the prototype.&nbsp; However, the only visible part on the 
      finished tender will be the outside edge which looks exactly like the 
      prototype. &nbsp; The sides will be made up 
      of lengths of 3/16&quot; X 4&quot; bar,&nbsp; 1/4&quot; X 1&quot; X 1&quot;&nbsp; 
      angle 
      and 3/16&quot; X 1.5&quot; X 1.5&quot; angle.&nbsp; The one leg of the 
      outer angle will be cut to match the curved profile of the side.&nbsp; The pieces will be held together 
      by #6 FH screws running from the top down into threaded holes in the 
      angles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Frame Bolster:</b> The tender frame bolster shown above 
      is similar to but somewhat simpler than the locomotive bolster.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      main piece is a length of 1.25&quot; X 2.5&quot; HRS bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pieces of 
      3/16&quot; X 1&quot; bar are welded to the bottom for the pads.&nbsp; The cylinder 
      that slides into the truck bolster is a piece of 1.875&quot; diameter bar 
      bolted to the main bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is surface the 
      bottom and bore the recess in the top on the lathe.&nbsp; The recess in 
      the top is for a&nbsp; external retaining ring on the truck pin.&nbsp; 
      The top of that pin will be below the top of the bolster so as to not interfere 
      with the tender floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Tender Frame Front:</b>&nbsp; The drawing above shows 
      the tender frame front which is a piece of 1/4&quot; HRS bar.&nbsp; I'll 
      probably weld or silver solder a couple pieces of 1/4&quot; X 3/16&quot; bar to the 
      edges of a 1/4' X 1.5&quot; bar to achieve the shape shown.&nbsp; The holes for 
      the #6 screws must align with the ends of the angles on the sides.&nbsp; 
      Mating holes will be tapped into the ends of those angles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      1/4&quot; holes will align with tapped holes in the end of the front coupler 
      support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be a hole in each side which 
      matches with a hole tapped in the upper edge of the front.&nbsp; The 
      position of these holes is shown on the drawing for the sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Tender Frame Rear:</b>&nbsp; The 
      drawing above shows the tender frame rear which is simply a piece of 1/4&quot; 
      X 1.5&quot;&nbsp; HRS bar.&nbsp; The holes for the #6 screws must aligned with 
      the ends of the angles on the sides.&nbsp; Mating holes will be tapped 
      into the ends of those angles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1/4&quot; hole will align with a 
      taped hole in the end of the rear coupler support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      There will be a hole in each side which 
      matches with a hole tapped in the upper edge of the rear.&nbsp; The 
      position of these holes is shown on the drawing for the sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font> </p>


      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Sills:</b>&nbsp; The sills are 1.375&quot; X 
      1.875&quot; X 16&quot; 
      pieces of hardwood.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is to try to get some pieces of 
      maple or cherry for the sills.&nbsp; While maple and cherry aren't as hard 
      as the oak sill used on the prototype, they have a finer grain which 
      should look more realistic for the model, especially if the sills are 
      stained rather than covered with a thick coat of paint. </font> </p>
