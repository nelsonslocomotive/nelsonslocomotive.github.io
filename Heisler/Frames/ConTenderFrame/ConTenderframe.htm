      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The tender frame construction was done in January when the 
      weather was really nasty ----- below zero every day and plenty of snow and 
      ice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coupler pocket for the link connecting the the 
      locomotive to the tender was done first using on-hand scrap steel.&nbsp; 
      The bolster was next also using on hand steel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once those 
      pieces were finished, a trip to the steel store secured the material 
      required to finish the frame.&nbsp; </font> </p>

            have 1.875&quot; X 2&quot; bar stock so I welded a 1/8&quot; square bar to piece of 
            1.75&quot; X 2&quot; bar left over from making the smoke box saddle.&nbsp; The 
            photo shows the 1/8&quot; square bar on the lower right side which will 
            become part of the base.&nbsp; Large pieces have been sawed off the 
            sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple 
            holes were also drilled in the end as a start on the hole for the 
            link.&nbsp; A hole was drilled in the side fo0r the link pin.&nbsp;

            end.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo shows the&nbsp; rotary table with collet 
            fixture mounted to the mill table.&nbsp; This was a convenient way 
            to hold a mandrel vertical.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mandrel was made by 
            sawing the head off a 3/8&quot; bolt. &nbsp; The block of steel is secured to the 
            mandrel with a locking nut.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nut is snug but not so 
            tight as to prevent the block from rotating.&nbsp; A rod is inserted in 
            a hole drilled in the base to both steady and rotate the block .&nbsp; 
            The mill X-Y table was used to move the block against the tool.&nbsp; 
            The block was then rotated using the rod to machine the curve.&nbsp; 
            Small cuts were taken --- on the order of 0.03&quot; or less. The block 
            was rotated in the same direction as the end mill so that the tool was 
            always trying to push the block back.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </td>

            These extensions were rough sawed to shape and attached to the top
