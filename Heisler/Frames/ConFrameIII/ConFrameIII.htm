            to the bottom plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step was to solder 
            the base plate and the angles at the sides to the bottom of the 
            saddle.&nbsp; Everything was pickled and fluxed and brass screws and 
            strip solder was used again.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time the propane torch 
            was used to heat the joints.&nbsp; </td>

            Photo above shows the top front of the finished saddle.&nbsp; I 
            forgot to mention that the holes to attach the smoke box&nbsp; to 
            the saddle were drilled in the curved base before it was soldered 
            in place.&nbsp; Several of the brass screws that held the port 
            plates in position also got soldered in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            After all the soldering was finished the screws were drilled out 
            from the bottom and the holes tapped again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

            This photo shows the finished bottom.&nbsp; After everything was 
            soldered the saddle was tested for leaks using water.&nbsp; There 
            were a couple small leaks around the base.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
            saddle was pickled again, the areas around the leaks fluxed and 
            pieces of a type of solder made to fill larger gaps (McMaster-Carr 
            #7676A3) were laid over the 
            leaking joins and then the joints were heated again.&nbsp; That 
            fixed all the leaks except small leaks out of the holes at the 
            bottom of the holes from the port screws.&nbsp; These holes will be 
            plugged with stainless setscrews.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            <p align="left">
            After all soldering was finished, the saddle was pickled again to 
            remove any remaining flux.&nbsp; The surfaces were then smoothed and 
            screw heads removed&nbsp; using the belt sander, files and a sanding 
            drum in the Dremel rotary tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; The final step was to 
            bead blast the saddle.&nbsp; It is now ready to paint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
