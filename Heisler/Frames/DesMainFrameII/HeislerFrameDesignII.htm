      <p align="left">It's been over a year since the Frame Design I pager was 
      first published.&nbsp; The boiler is being fabricated and&nbsp;the foundry is 
      in the process of casting the engine parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be nice 
      to make the frame now so that there would be a place to mount the engine 
      when it is finished.&nbsp; Normally the frame sides would be constructed 
      and jointed together with the frame bolsters.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the 
      frame bolster castings will likely not be available for many months.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      An alternative is to fabricate the saddle, sills and associated fixtures and use 
      them to hold the frame together until the bolsters arrive.&nbsp; So, it's time 
      to finish the design of the diamond frame and then design those sills and associated fixtures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            for MRSR91 is shown in the photo on the right.&nbsp; There are 
            actually two castings on each side. The rear casting is mostly in 
            the cab.&nbsp; The joint between the to castings is between the 
            4th and 5th vertical slot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to make the part of 
            the stiffener inside the cab out of smooth plate and make a single 
            slotted stiffer design with five slots. The same design will be used 
            on both sides.&nbsp; The protrusion on the bottom is additional 
            support for the boiler mount.&nbsp; This support will be added as a 
            separate part later.&nbsp; (<a href="../DesMainFrameIII/HeislerFrameDesignIII.htm">See

      <p align="left">The drawing above shows the saddle 
      design.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is to assemble it from stock bars, plate and a 
      piece of tube.&nbsp;&nbsp; The center will be a steel block sandwiched 
      between 3/16&quot; 
      thick steel plates silver soldered to the front and back.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      vertical passages will be drilled from the top.&nbsp;&nbsp; The horizontal 
      passages will be milled from the bottom.&nbsp; The bottom will then be 
      covered with a 1/8&quot; thick plate. The sides and bottom plate as well as the 
      1/2&quot; angles on the bottom will be silver soldered in place,&nbsp; &nbsp;The 
      two flange like&nbsp; exhaust openings will be separate pieces silver 
      soldered to the center block.&nbsp;&nbsp;More detail will be shown in the 
      construction page.&nbsp;&nbsp; This drawing was updated on 1/9/2007 to 
      reflect minor changes made when the saddle was fabricated.&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Rear part of frame:&nbsp; </b>Much of the rear part of 
      the frame is obscured by the coal bunker on Cass 6 and 
      the oil tank on MRSR91.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo below shows the rear 
      part of the frame of a late Heisler.&nbsp; The MRSR91 frame has an 
      identical structure albeit a bit larger.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the seam 
      between the two frame bars is even with the top of the rear sill, the 
      bolster and that cross piece.&nbsp; The upper frame bar extends 
      about half way across the top of the rear sill.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom of the 
      cab sides and the bottom of bunker/oil tank sides are also even with seam between the two frame 
      bars.&nbsp; The bottom of the oil tank rests on the top of the upper frame 
      bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to not have the cross piece on the model: I 
      want to keep that area as free as possible to accommodate oil, atomizer 
      and feed water plumbing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is to have the bottom of the 
      oil tank about  2.5&quot; above the top of the bolster.&nbsp; The igniter 
      circuit and coil as well as a sealed lead acid 
      battery will housed in the space between the bottom of the oil tank and 
      the top of the frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            channel even with the bottom of the floor.&nbsp; The higher 
            channel and the use of a 1/8&quot; thick floor will obviate the need for
