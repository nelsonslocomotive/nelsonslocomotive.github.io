            <td width="50%"><b>Bolster: </b>The step in fabricating the bolsters 
            was to cut notches in the ends of the 1.25&quot; X 2.5' bars and to weld 
            on 3/16&quot; thick bar stock for the pads.&nbsp; The bars after these 
            operations are shown above.<p>The next step.&nbsp; was to mount the 
            bar and angle on each end.&nbsp; Each bar and angle is held in place 
            by a pair of 6-32 FH screws.&nbsp; A weld bead is then run along the 
            seam on the top where where the plate joins the bar and also along 
            the&nbsp; the seam on the bottom where the angle joins the bar. </p>
            <p>After the welding the bolster was mounted in&nbsp; the 4-jaw 
            chuck as shown on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lathe was then used to 
            turn the bar thickness down to 1.213&nbsp; thickness.&nbsp; The 
            slope in the pads was also turned at this point.&nbsp; The final 
            step was drill the center hole and turn a shallow recess for the 
            cylindrical shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
