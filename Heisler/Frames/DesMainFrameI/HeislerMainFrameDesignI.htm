      <p align="left">The frame ties the major parts of the locomotive together.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the design process quite a few 
      parts were made slightly over scale, usually by rounding up dimensions.&nbsp; 
      It was also desirable to provide a slightly greater space around the 
      engine to ease maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The net effect of these 
      alternations is that the overall length of the frame including the sills 
      is 61.5&quot;, about 2&quot; or 3% over exact scale.&nbsp; The Cass 6 frame drawings 
      can be scaled by any who are offended by this deviation from exact 
      scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


      <p align="left">This page describes the design of the model frame sides 
      and frame bolster.&nbsp; This design was updated in June 2006 to reflect 
      some minor changes made to better match the boiler and match with the 
      additional frame components described in the subsequent frame design 
      pages.&nbsp;&nbsp; The page was updated again in February 2007 after the 
      frame was actually fabricated.&nbsp; The major change with this update was 
      to show a machined frame bolster to substitute for the cast bolster 
      originally planned. </p>


      <p align="left"><b>Diamond Frame: </b>The photo below&nbsp; shows the 
      diamond frame of a late Heisler that is somewhat smaller than MRSR91.&nbsp; 
      Having the cab and boiler off reveals details normally hidden.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The vertical casting next to the smoke box saddle is a mount for a duplex 
      air pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Heisler.&nbsp;These same type stiffeners are used on MSR91.&nbsp; (On 
            Cass 6 the center stiffeners are double plates, one on each side of 
            the frame bars.)&nbsp; The painted (primed) part in the photo is 
            inside the cab.&nbsp; Note also that there are two castings, one 
            that is inside the cab and the other that is mostly to the front of 
            the cab.&nbsp; I decided to deviate from this design slightly and 
            use a plate stiffener inside the cab where it isn't noticeable and 
            then make a slotted&nbsp; stiffener for the part in front of the cab.&nbsp; 
            One stiffener design should be usable on both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
            should be able to assemble the frame without the slotted stiffener and 
            hence defer that part of the design.</td>

      <p align="left">The frame side bars shown in the drawing above are made 
      from 9/16&quot; cold rolled or cold formed steel bar stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw 
      cuts will be made about 75% of the way through at the point of each bend.&nbsp; 
      After all the bends have been made the gaps will be filled with weld and 
      then ground and/or filed smooth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left">The stiffening plates shown in the drawing above are all 
      cut from 1/8&quot; thick steel plate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Four of the rear plates 
      (HM402) and four front plates (HM404) are required.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only two 
      of the middles plates (HM403) are required.&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left">The drawing above shows the assembled frame side.&nbsp; 
      The initial plan was to use 1/8' steel rivets to attach the plates to the 
      side bars but however, in the end 6-32 button head cap screws were used to 
      simulate the rivets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawings with exact rivet (screw) screw locations 
      are given in the construction pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left">
      The goal for this page was to get enough of the frame design done so that 
      the bolster pattern could be fabricated since the castings are the long 
      lead time items.&nbsp; The majority if not all of the remaining frame 
      parts will be fabricated from stock sheet and bars.</p>


      <p align="left">
      <b>Update February 2007:</b> The process of making casting molds proved to 
      be more lengthily than originally thought and the interval to obtain the 
      castings from the foundry has proven to be very long and in some cases,&nbsp; 
      apparently forever.&nbsp;&nbsp; The frame fabrication was essentially 
      complete except for the bolster so the bolster design was given a second 
      look and found to be fairly easy to fabricate from bar and angle&nbsp; 
      stock.&nbsp; The following is the bolster design actually used on the 
      frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="FrameBolsterMachined.jpg" width="700" height="550"></p>


      <p align="left">
      The main part of the bolster is a 1.25&quot; X 2.5&quot; HRS bar.&nbsp; The ends are 
      finished with 3/16&quot; X 1.125&quot; bars stock and 3/16&quot; thick angles.&nbsp; A 1&quot; 
      X 1&quot; X3/16&quot; angle was cut down to the correct size.&nbsp; The end plates 
      and angles were attached to the bar with 10-32 FH screws.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Pieces of 1.125&quot; X 3/16&quot; bars were&nbsp; welded to the bottom for the 
      truck roller pads.&nbsp; The bottom was then turned to give the main bar 
      the correct thickness and the pads the correct slope.&nbsp; The cylinder 
      that extends below the main bar to mate with the truck bolster was made as 
      a separate piece and then attached the main bar with a couple 10-32 
      screws.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the rear bolster has a 1.875&quot; 
      diameter X 3/8&quot; deep recess in the top.&nbsp; This recess will allow the 
      use of an external retaining ring on the truck bolster pin and have the 
      top of the pin below the&nbsp; top of the bolster so as not to interfere 
      with the electrical compartment under the oil tank.&nbsp;&nbsp; A hairpin 
      clip will be used on the front truck pin and the clip will be above the 
      bolster to permit access. </p>

      <b>Bolster Brackets: </b>The three drawings above show the brackets 
      that&nbsp;clamp the frame sides to the bolsters and smoke box 
      saddle to the frame sides.&nbsp; These brackets will be made by&nbsp;soldering or welding 
      1/8&quot; thick angle to 3/16&quot; CRS bars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
