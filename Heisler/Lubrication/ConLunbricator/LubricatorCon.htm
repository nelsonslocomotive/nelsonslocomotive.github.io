            solder, even after cleaning it in the pickling solution failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            solder.&nbsp; Several different leaf-free solders were tried and 
            none worked.&nbsp; What did work very well was a 97% lead-3% silver

            drilling long straight holes on the drill press.&nbsp; Have had good 
            success doing so on the lathe.&nbsp; However, the jaws on my 4-jaw 
            check are too big to mount the 1/2&quot; diameter eccentrics with the 
            required offset.&nbsp; The next try was the setup shown on the right 
            using a V-Block in the vise on the mill.&nbsp; The vise base and back 
            surfaces are very close to being horizontal and vertical and the 
            V-Block is also very accurately machined.&nbsp; The holes were 
            center drilled first and then drilled 1/4&quot;.&nbsp; The difference in 
            the width of the thinner wall at the two ends was less than 0.001&quot; 
            which is perfectly straight for this application. 
            <p>The first eccentric has the hole closer to the side than planned.&nbsp; 
            The table was adjusted to correct this error before the other three 
            eccentrics were drilled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This eccentric with the 
            extra large throw was used to drive the two main steam oil pumps for 
            the engine cylinders --- these two pumps require the greatest output.&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

      considerably after a bit of oil was added and the drive turned with an 
      drill for a few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


        <p align="left">
      The lubricator will need to be tested before installation to verify all 
      the pumps are working and a pressure test will need to be done of the 
      three steam oil pumps to verify that they can overcome at least 150 psi.&nbsp; 
      Will come back and update this after the test. </p>
