												<strong>Headlamps: </strong>The 
												Critter Controller uses Pulse 
												Width Modulation (PWM) to 
												operate 12 volt incandescent 
												lamps from 24 volts.&nbsp; The 
												PWM switches the negative lead 
												from the lamps on and off about 
												2000 times a second.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												For full brightness it is on and 
												off exactly the same amount of 
												time or 50% duty cycle.&nbsp; 
												The average voltage across the 
												lamp is thus half of 24 volts or 12 
												volts.&nbsp; To dim the lights&nbsp; 
												the duty cycle is decreased 
												further to make the average 
												voltage less than 12 volts.&nbsp; 
												The headlamp switch on the 
												handset is held on for several 
												second to turn the head lamps on 
												and off.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
												momentary push of the head light 
												switch dims the headlamps and a 
												second push returns them to full 
												brightness.<br><br>In normal 
												forward operation the headlamp 
												switch turns on the front 
												headlamp to full brightness and 
												the rear lamp on but much 
												dimmer.&nbsp; The brightness of 
												the rear lamp is set by an 
												option in the setup menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												When the drive is set to 
												reverse, the rear lamp becomes 
												the headlamp and the front lamp 
												becomes the tail lamp.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></span><br>
												<br>I originally used the front 
												part of small LED flashlights 
												mounted in the headlamp castings 
												from the Goose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												I put a resistor in series with 
												the units to operate them from 
												12 volts.&nbsp; They weren't 
												very bright when operated 
												directly from 12 volts.&nbsp; They worked 
												with the Critter Controller but 
												still weren't very bright and the 
												dimming settings had essentially 
												no effect.&nbsp; <br><br>

														That second lamp worked

														the lamp's margins so I 
														tried some series 
														resistors (15, 10, 7.5

													<strong>Brakes: </strong>&nbsp; 
													The convenience of having 
													the brake control on the 
													handset convinced me to 
													purchase one of the Integral 
													Circuits Brake Controllers.&nbsp; 
													They make two versions, the 
													BC-100 that works with a 
													storage reservoir (air tank) 
													and the BC-50 that doesn't 
													need a reservoir.&nbsp;&nbsp;
													<br><br>&nbsp;I chose the 
													simpler BC-50.&nbsp; The 
													connections of the various 
													components is&nbsp; shown in 
													the diagram on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
													When brakes are called for 
													on the handset the signal is 
													sent to the Critter 
													Controller and then on to 
													the BC-50.&nbsp; The BC-50 
													will then turn on the 
													compressor.&nbsp; The BC-50 
													monitors the pressure and 
													when it gets to the 
													requested pressure the power 
													to the compressor is turned 
													off (usually less than a 
													second).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
													line and brake cylinder will 
													retain the air pressure and 
													the check valve prevents it 
													from bleeding off through 
													the leaky compressor valves.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
													When the call for releasing 
													the brakes is entered into 
													the handset (brake button 
													released)&nbsp; the signal is 
													sent to the Critter 
													Controller and then on to 
													the BC-50 where it operates 
													the release valve to let the 
													air out of the cylinder. <br>
													<br>The BC-50 together with 
													the Critter Controller monitors the 
													air pressure and uses the 
													combination of turning on 
													the compressor to increase 
													the pressure and operating 
													the release valve to reduce 
													the pressure.<br><br>There 
													is a possibility that this 
													system can oscillate so 
													Laura suggests 1/16&quot; ID hose 
													be used to the release valve 
													and the pressure sensing 
													port.&nbsp; (The normal 
													Clippard hose is 1/8&quot; ID.)&nbsp; Also, the pressure sensing 
													should be as close as 
													possible to the cylinder.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
													I didn't have problems with 
													oscillations but did put a 
													restricted exhaust fitting&nbsp; 
													(~.05&quot; ID) on the &nbsp;release 
													valve. &nbsp;
