							<span class="style15">The frame was constructed over two years ago and 
		  many of the drawings were out of date.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried to bring 
		  everything up to date but errors likely abound.&nbsp; If you find 
		  something that doesn't seem to add up, you're probably correct.&nbsp; 
		  The primary reason for providing this information is to give ideas to 
		  others who might want to undertake a similar project.&nbsp; <br><br>
		  <img height="443" src="RailBusOverview.jpg" width="999"><br>Before 
		  attacking the frame a bit about the big pieces.&nbsp; The roof or lid 
		  is held on by two bolts at the back which also serve as the hinge 
		  pins.&nbsp; The nose consisting of the cab and engine compartment is 
		  retained by two screws.&nbsp; The main body has four studs that extend 
		  through the main frame and is held in place by four nuts on the underside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		  It takes about ten minutes to get down to the fame and motors, 
		  batteries, etc.&nbsp; Note that the length is shown as ~62&quot; and I said 
			in the overview that I needed to keep the length to 66&quot; to fit into 
			the Escape.&nbsp; The couplers are missing in the drawing above 
			which will bring the length to ~66&quot;<br><br>Many of the drawings 
							contain details that are hard to see on the webpage 
							--- especially for us old folks.&nbsp; I'm including 
							pdf files of the more interesting drawings.&nbsp; 
							The PDF can be downloaded by clicking the link:
							<a href="RailBusOverview.pdf">Railbus.pdf </a>.&nbsp; 
							The image can be viewed in pdf viewer software such 
							as Adobe Acrobat or Foxit pdf viewer. The images are 
							easily magnified in the viewer and the image can 
							also be printed from the viewer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							<br><br>Larry Simoneau gave me some advice on batteries and chargers.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		  He's had good luck with the WalMart Deep Cycle batteries and also 
		  recommended a charger --- more about the charger later.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of 
		  the decisions was do I want to run on 12 volts, 24 volts or 36 volts?&nbsp; 
		  Most the small locomotives use 24 volts and most of the small motors 
		  operate well on 24 volts.&nbsp; With batteries, the cost per unit of 
		  capacity is reduced as one increases the physical size so bigger is 
			better.&nbsp; 
		  I found that there was room for two of the the WalMart maxx EverStart 
							29DC batteries with the properties described below.

		<p align="left" class="style10">The 61.7 lbs is more than I expected but 
		they do contain lots of lead.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are similar size 29 
		batteries available from other suppliers with the same footprint but 
		most that I've found are not as tall.&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall capacity is 
		not indicated in the published&nbsp; specifications; data on the 
		Internet suggests that the capacity is 100 to 125 amp hours.&nbsp; I've had the first set 
		for three years now and they seem like new.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, no 
		activity in the winter here in Ohio unless I use them for ice fishing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The batteries are connected in series to give 24 volts.

		The image above gives the general layout (File:
							<a href="RailBusOverviewTop.jpg">Top)</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The batteries and 
		motors will bring the weight to well over 100 lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other 
		components, front truck and body bring the total weight to about 200 
		lbs.&nbsp; The engineer is pretty skinny but wears very heavy clothes so 
		that will add over 200 pounds more.&nbsp; Fortunately the wife is very 
		slender so we can plan on a total weight of 500 to 600 lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		That sort of weight calls or a robust frame; we don't want a swayback 
		Railbus.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<p align="left" class="style10">

		Now we're getting down to the details (File: <a href="RailBusFrame1.pdf">
							Frame</a>).&nbsp; I had some 1.5&quot; angle and 
		1.5&quot; channel so that is what I used.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two channels at the 
		back and the two over the front truck have the legs pointing up.&nbsp; I 
		milled 1/8&quot; off&nbsp; the legs that fit under the side angles so the top 
		of the legs between the angles are even with the top of the side 
		angles.&nbsp;&nbsp; These channels were bolted in place with one 1/4&quot; 
					bolt on each end of each channel with the nuts on the bottom.&nbsp; 
		Once everything was square I tack welded each channel in place.&nbsp; 
		(I'm not much of a welder.&nbsp; Bolting things in place and then tacking 
		them with my flux-in-wire welder works for me.&nbsp; All welds are on 
		the under side and hidden from the view of real welders.)<p align="left" class="style10">
		The top of the front angle is notched so the horizontal part is even 
		with the horizontal part of the side angles.&nbsp; The joints between 
		the front and side angles were then butt welded on the under side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<p align="left" class="style10">The square tubes reinforcing the side 
		angles were then bolted in place using 1/4&quot; bolts that also go 
		through the ends of the three channels under the batteries.&nbsp; After 
		the tubes were secured with the 6 bolts they were tack welded to the 
		side angles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last two angles at each end of the battery area 
		were then installed and secured with 1/4&quot; bolts at each end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<table style="width: 100%">

				<td><span class="style15">Photo on right shows the frame after the the drive module 
				was installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of interest here is the spacers 
				between the sides of the battery and the frame angles.&nbsp; 
				That is 5/4&quot; (1&quot; actual) Trex deck planking left over from a  
				deck project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spacers extend&nbsp; under 
				the angle for 3/8&quot;.&nbsp; The bolts holding the channels and 
				angles under the batteries were loosened&nbsp; to get the Tex 
				under the side angles and then tightened to hold it in place.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Note the heads of the bolts holding the channels and angles; I used hex head 
				bolts and 
				tacked welded the heads so it was easy to install the Nyloc nuts 
				below.&nbsp; Turns out that part of those heads interfered with 
				the frame for the body so I had to grind off part of the heads.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Next time I'll use flat head bolts. <br>
				</span><br class="style15"><span class="style15">A big worry is that the batteries&nbsp; become loose and 
				turn into battering rams.&nbsp; The spacers on the sides and the 
				angles at each end of the batteries keep them from sliding 
				around.&nbsp; There are also clamping bars over the top of each 
				battery to hold it down. </span> </td>

		<p align="left" class="style10"><strong>After everything was constructed

		The battery area consisting of the three middle channels and the angles

		Trucks</a> .&nbsp; Any style truck

		I got tired of making drawings so used a couple photos to describe the 
		front.&nbsp; That is 1&quot; X 1/8&quot; flat stock and then 1&quot; X 1&quot; X 1/8&quot; angle 
		below the flat stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; The angles and flat are held in place 
		by screws through 1.5&quot; channels centered 1.5&quot; from each side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				attached to another piece of 1.5&quot; channel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
				channel with the foot pegs is held to the front with a couple 
				screws; those button head screws visible on the previous photo.&nbsp; 
				Part of the lower leg of the foot peg channel directly in front 
				of the wheels interferes with the wheels and has to be ground

		This photo was taken a couple years ago when I was painting the frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The square tubes sticking up are 1&quot; X 1&quot; X 1/8&quot; and go up 10&quot; above the 
		deck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are attached to the 2&quot; angle and against the 
		outside angle.&nbsp; I think I bolted them to the 2&quot; angle and then tack 
		welded them<span class="style5"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="style10">.&nbsp;
							</span></font></span>They are sticking up and waving in the breeze necessitating 
		the&nbsp; angle braces made of 3/4&quot; X 1/8&quot; flat stock.&nbsp; That is 
		1/8&quot; (11 gauge) plate covering the front deck and attached to the 
		vertical tubes.&nbsp; The&nbsp; charger is attached to the plate on the 
		vertical tubes.&nbsp; The charger is fairly heavy hence the robust 
		mount.&nbsp; Those side braces are 3/4&quot; X 1/8&quot; flat stock.&nbsp; The grate in the deck is to permit air flow when the 
		charger is doing its thing.&nbsp; <strong>Note: if the three channels 
		and two angles supporting the batteries are move forward 5/8&quot; as 
		described earlier, the height of the two tubes holding the charger must 
		be reduced to 7.5&quot; to prevent interference with the body.&nbsp; The top 
		of the posts would then be even with the top of the plate between the 
		posts.&nbsp; </strong>
		<p align="left" class="style10">
		The truss rods are 3/16&quot; and the turnbuckles were originally 
		threaded #8 but are easily enlarged to 10-32 (I only have10-32 left hand taps and dies).&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		posts are 1/4&quot; square and extend down 2.5&quot; below the frame.&nbsp; I 
		drilled holes through the tube that is attached to the frame angle to 
		get enough length against the inside of the frame angle to make a solid 
		attachment for the front posts.&nbsp;&nbsp; That front post is roughly in line with the center 
		support channel for the front battery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Things are a little 
		crowded towards the back.&nbsp; The channel holding the rear foot pegs is 
		attached to the frame angle-tube combination with pieces of angle.&nbsp; 
		The front of the channel holding the pegs is aligned with the front edge 
		of the middle support channel under the rear battery.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		rear truss rod post is attached to the foot peg channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The rear end of the truss rod is attached to the side of the rear axel 
		journal rail.&nbsp; 
		<p align="left" class="style10">
		The four rods sticking up are used to clamp the batteries down.&nbsp; 
		The rods are 3/8&quot; diameter&nbsp; with the ends turned down to 1/4&quot; and 
		threaded 1/4-20.&nbsp; The bottom end of the rods go into the middle
