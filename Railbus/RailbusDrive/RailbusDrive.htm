						This graphic shows the entire drive.&nbsp; (File:

						4&quot;X9-1/4&quot;X3/8&quot; aluminum vertical and 1/8&quot; aluminum angle 
						stiffening plates on each side.&nbsp; The four pieces of 
						the mount are screwed together.&nbsp; The motors are 
						attached to the vertical with a pair of 6 mm screws 
						each.&nbsp;&nbsp; The motor on the front side (left side

						fixed.&nbsp; The rear motor rests on the base but slides to 
						adjust the chain tension.&nbsp; The chain tension is tricky 
						and very small movements can change the chain from too 
						loose to too tight.&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally tapped a 10-32 hole in 
						the side of the aluminum nose of the rear motor in line 
						with the shaft and horizontal.&nbsp;&nbsp; A mating hole was 
						drilled in the stiffing plate, and a 10-32 screw was 
						inserted to make a fine tension adjustment.&nbsp; The 
						attachment screws can be loosened, the tension adjusted 
						with the 10-32 screw and the&nbsp; attachment screws

						<br>The drive assembly has worked well over the two 
						summers of operation.&nbsp; However, experience&nbsp; 
						can always lead to improvements.&nbsp; (File:
								<a href="DriveImprovements.pdf">Drive 
								Improvements</a>). Dan Staron early 
						on told me that it is bad practice to connect more then 
						two sprockets, especially two motors on a single chain.&nbsp; 
						It causes the sprockets and chain to wear quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						His experience is with large machinery.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
						sprockets show wear but I don't know if the wear is 
						normal.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>After sprucing up the 
						original drawings it became obvious that I could install 
						a second large sprocket on the axel and point one motor 
						each direction as shown in the drawing above. An 
						advantage of two chains is that one can make it back to 
						the shop if one chain comes off thus avoiding the 
						humiliation of being towed. <br><br>If there is a motor 
						pointing each direction then if the axel is centered on 
						the mount (slid toward the back 1&quot;) then the same size 
						chain can be used on both sides.&nbsp; This is a 
						slippery side as the journals must be moved (OK on new 
						construction) or the batteries must be moved still 
						further toward the front.&nbsp; Different size chains 
						don't look so bad now. <br><br>Another concern is the 
						load on the chain.&nbsp;&nbsp; McMaster says that #25 
						chain has a working load of 88 lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
						earlier graph on the motor indicated that the maximum 
						torque is about 1.5 Newton Meters that converts to ~13.3 
						inch pounds.&nbsp; The 11 tooth sprocket has a pitch 
						diameter of about 7/8&quot; so the lever arm is 7/16&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						Thus the 1.4 NM torque converts to 13.5/0.4375 = ~30.8 
						lbs.&nbsp; The total for two motors is a little over 60 lbs so well within the 88 lb chain working load limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						The wheels usually start slipping at about 25 amps per 
						motor which corresponds to a about 1.5 Nm 
						torque so chain load is far from an issue. <br><hr> <br>
