      <p align="left"><em>T</em></span><em><span class="style10">his 
	  introduction page was penned in the spring of 2015 with the intent of 
	  following with a description of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus was too 
	  much fun and the weather was too nice to work at the computer back in 
	  2015.&nbsp; The Railbus has evolved a bit since the version shown in this 
	  introduction but is still great fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interest in the 
	  website has perked up again so I'm publishing this introduction with the 
	  intent of adding design information as time and interest permits</span></em><span class="style6"><span class="style10">.</span></span><span class="style10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p align="left" class="style10">I've envied those 
	  with small battery powered locomotives they bring to the track, unload 
	  quickly and are off in a few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course they miss out 
	  on the oil, grease, soot, burned fingers and wet clothing the live 
	  steamers enjoy before they open the throttle the first time.&nbsp; Last 
	  fall (fall of 2014) I decided to make such a vehicle my winter project.</p>
		<p align="left" class="style10">The first step was to look over the readily available 
		kits such as those from Plum Cove Studios and the Rio Grande Southern 
		Galloping Goose castings, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; None of these seemed be what I 
		wanted.&nbsp; After some thought I came up with the following 
		requirements:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style10">The unit must fit with my short line logging 
			operation of the first third of the last century. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style10">It must be a single unit.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style10">It must be able to carry two people ---&nbsp; if I 
			take it someplace with the wife there must be a place for her to 
			ride too.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style10">It must fit in the back of my small SUV (Ford 
			Escape) with the rear seats folded down --- about 66 inches. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p align="left" class="style10">It must operate equally well in forward and reverse 
			(seats reverse).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="style12">&nbsp;The next step was to search the Internet for images of 
		suitable prototypes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stumbled on Rail Buses along 
		the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; These came in many shapes and sizes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The one I selected to model is shown below; hope I'm not infringing on a 
		copyright.</p>

		I believe this to be a HO scale model.&nbsp; There are several other examples of similar HO models.&nbsp; I didn't find any 
		photos of similar full size prototypes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The vehicle seems to 
		carry both passengers and freight --- possibly railway express and maybe 
		a post office.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is driven by an internal combustion engine 
		--- gasoline or possibly diesel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found several 
		references to Mack Rail Buses&nbsp; which I guessed to be powered by 
		Mack Truck engines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some quick calculations from 
		measurements taken from the image indicated that a 1/8 scale length of 
		about 66 
		inches --- about 44 feet full size. 
		<p align="left">After lots of design and redesign, construction and 
		reconstruction the bus turned out as follows: </p>

		<span class="style10
		<p align="left>T</span><span class="style10">he nose is a casting for the RGS Goose in about 2.5&quot; 
		scale.&nbsp;&nbsp; The height is reduced to give a more appropriate 
		profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lights are also Goose castings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The seats with swivel bases are from Walmart.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; The front 
		truck is a standard logging car/freight car truck of the era (see
		<a href="../Small%20Projects/Trucks/Trucks.htm">Arch Bar Trucks</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The rear axel with 5.8 inch wheels are from a junked switcher engine 
		(gift from Dick McCloy).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
		
		<p align="left"><img height="858" src="Front.JPG" width="1000"></p>
		</span>
		<p align="left" class="style10">The foot pegs are aftermarket from Heeters.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
		<span class="style10">
		<p align="left"><img height="891" src="Back.JPG" width="1000"></p>
		</span>
		<p align="left" class="style10">When the seats are reversed,&nbsp; the person in front 
		(in the back when reversed) uses the pegs between the seats.&nbsp; The 
		angle under the rear coupler slides out about six inches to provide a 
		foot rest for the other person.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p align="left"><img height="601" src="Controls.JPG" width="1000"></p>
		</span>
		<p align="left" class="style10">This is the control panel.&nbsp; The two gauges are for 
		the air brakes; one indicates tank pressure (about 60 psi) and the other 
		indicates the applied pressure (zero to about 60 psi).&nbsp; The brass 
		handle is the brake valve, a modified Clippard regulator from Tom Bee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The brakes are off when lever is to the right, full on when pointing to 
		the left.&nbsp;&nbsp; The switches on the right&nbsp; are air compressor 
		(on) front headlight (off) and rear headlight (also off) and of course 
		the horn button.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The toggle switch on the control box 
		in the center controls the direction (forward, reverse and center off).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The knob controls the speed.&nbsp; The digital meter displays battery 
		voltage (0-30V) and motor current (0-50A).&nbsp;&nbsp; The digits on the 
		display are pulsed which is not noticeable to the human eye but easily 
		captured in this fast shutter photo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The control box lifts 
		off and has about 5 feet of cord to permit operation when the seat is 
		reversed&nbsp; or if the operator wishes to walk beside the bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>(The motor control consisted of a kit for the high current bridge and 
		a self designed low power logic to generate the PWM pulses to control the 
		bridge.&nbsp; The operation was great except for a couple hiccups.&nbsp; 
		However, I became envious of those with hand held radio linked controls.&nbsp; 
		Last fall (2016) my circuitry suffered a severe fault--- the kind of 
		fault that makes smoke.&nbsp; I just couldn't get the energy up to 
		rebuild the controller so I opted to buy an off-the-shelf unit with 
		radio control.&nbsp; More about that later.&nbsp;&nbsp; The control 
		panel will need to modified to accommodate the new handset.)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
