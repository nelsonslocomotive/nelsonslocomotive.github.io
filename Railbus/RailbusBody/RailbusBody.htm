							<br><span class="style18">The frame for the body is 
							made of square steel tubes for the main body and 
							aluminum angles and plates for the cab.&nbsp; <br>

							<img height="394" src="BodyFrame.jpg" width="999"><br>
							The&nbsp; Body Frame is welded together.&nbsp; 
							(File: <a href="BodyFrame.pdf">Body Frame</a>).&nbsp; 
							The gusset straps in the corners&nbsp; keep the 
							frame rigid.&nbsp; <br><br>
							<img height="431" src="BodySheeting.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>
							</span><br>
							<span class="style18">The skeletal frame is covered 
							with plywood sheeting much like was done in 
							house construction in the past.&nbsp; (File:
							<a href="BodySheeting.pdf">Sheeting</a>). The red 
							lines on the drawing above show the outline of the 
							plywood. The plywood is attached to the frame using 
							10-32 flat head screws into tapped holes in the 
							steel tubes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hole tapping was quick 
							--- I put the tap in a hand drill on slow speed.&nbsp; 
							Once the plywood was attached the body was really 
							rigid as required for over 400 lbs of load (heavy 
							lid). <br><br>
							<img height="441" src="Siding.jpg" width="1000"><br>
							</span><br class="style18"><span class="style18">The 
							next step was to apply the&nbsp; 3/4&quot; X 1/4&quot; siding.&nbsp; 
							I cut the siding from larger pieces of 1/4&quot; thick 
							basswood purchased at a local craft store.&nbsp; The 
							boards are glued and then tacked at the ends and 
							middle with 
							small brads.&nbsp;&nbsp; The top and middle nails 
							are covered by a trim stip.&nbsp; I was careful to 
							not make big dents around the nails at the bottom.&nbsp; 
							I applied the boards with the frame on the side so 
							the boards were on the top and then put weighs on 
							the boards to hold them in place until the glue 
							dried.&nbsp; I see I put a 1/4&quot; board on the bottom 
							of the window holes --- can't remember why.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
							The next step was to install the 3/4&quot; X 1/4&quot; window 
							and door frame boards&nbsp;&nbsp; These board are 
							cut to a length for a snug fit and glued in place.&nbsp; The front 
							edge of the trim boards stick out 1/4&quot; from the 
							siding to create the effect of a frame trim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							<br><br>
							<img height="448" src="Overview.jpg" width="999"><br>
							This is a repeat of a drawing used in the Frame 
							section.&nbsp; The drawing is accurate --- I made it 
							early in the process and literally counted boards 
							during the construction.&nbsp; (File:
							<a href="RailBusOverview.pdf">Overview</a>). The 
							drawing is useful when zoomed in on the pdf file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
							One of my early concerns was to not end up with some 
							narrow boards at the ends or at openings that would 
							be difficult to secure.&nbsp; Note that the window 
							pitch is exactly 7 boards or 5.25&quot;&nbsp; <br><br>

									between the windows to the piece below. I 
									chose&nbsp; to piece together the sheeting

							It's very difficult to make a 2- D drawing of the

							I started by installing the 1/2&quot; wide board at the 
							front of the sides with the front edge even with the 
							frame angle. The second board was the 1/2&quot; wide one 
							behind the door.&nbsp;&nbsp; The front edge&nbsp; of

							All the boards are glued to the aluminum frame 
							with epoxy adhesive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The door outside 
							pieces are 1/2&quot; X 1/8&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two 
							side pieces and top and bottom pieces are glued to 
							the 1/8&quot; lip on the siding.&nbsp; The lower panel 
							made of 1/8&quot; plywood is glued in place next.&nbsp; 
							The top of the panel is 1/8&quot; below the top of the 
							cross piece.&nbsp; The cross piece is glued to the 
							panel next.&nbsp; The plastic pane is installed 
							last. <br><br>The front vertical siding is all 3/4&quot; 
							except the two ends&nbsp; that are 1/2&quot; wide.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
							I installed the two end pieces and the three in the 
							middle first.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pieces above and below 
							the windows were next.&nbsp; The six lower&nbsp; 
							3/4&quot; pieces were installed last.&nbsp;&nbsp; There 
							is a 1/8&quot; lip for the pane on the outside edges and 
							1/4&quot; on the top and bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
