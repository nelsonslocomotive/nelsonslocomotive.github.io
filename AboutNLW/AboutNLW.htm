        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Nelson's Locomotive Works </b>is devoted to
        live
        steam geared locomotives.&nbsp; &nbsp; The term <b>Works </b>is appropriate since my
        primary interest is in the construction of the locomotives.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Don't be misled,&nbsp; the works is located in the basement workshop and
        I'm the CEO, CFO, Chief Engineer and most importantly, the
        janitor.&nbsp; My background is electrical engineering
      with a 30 year career in R&amp;D followed by a 9 year career teaching at a local community
      college.&nbsp; My only current&nbsp; employment is with <b> NLW</b> (no
        paycheck - and
        I hope to keep it that way).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Some 30 years ago I
        constructed 1/4&quot; scale models of geared locomotives that were electric powered --- the
        classic model trains.&nbsp; At the time I thought that I'd like to make
        a live steam model someday.&nbsp; However, the project seemed just too
        big with family and career.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in one of my mid life crisis's,
      I bought a used British Roadster, a Triumph TR6.&nbsp; The
        TRs have occupied much of my spare time on and off since.&nbsp; My main
      Triumph
      interest was the restoration.&nbsp;
      (Six months after I bought the first one it was in the basement in
      pieces.)&nbsp; Once a TR was restored I lost interest.&nbsp; They are fun to drive, but not near as much fun as
        tearing apart and rebuilding.&nbsp; So, before one was finished, another
      one was on deck.&nbsp; &nbsp;I ran out of room to work on the TRs in the fall of
        2002.&nbsp; There was near panic as winter was approaching and I had no
        project.&nbsp; Then I thought of building a live steam Shay locomotive and
      peace came.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Shortly after starting the Shay project
      some Triumph buddies inquired as to the progress. Turns out, many of
      them are also interested in live steam locomotives, especially the geared
      locomotives.&nbsp; I initially added some pages to a Triumph website
      (which I webmaster) to track the progress&nbsp; of the Shay.&nbsp; As the
      locomotive project grew I split off the locomotive pages and started <b>Nelson's Locomotive Works</b>.&nbsp;</font> </p>

              work is required to make&nbsp; a&nbsp; live
              steam locomotive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both backbreaking manual labor
              and&nbsp; intellectual activities such as research are
              involved. (And the spouses think we're having fun.) &nbsp;&nbsp; The photo
              shows the NLW Chief Engineer
              (on the left) doing laborious research -- in this case,&nbsp;&nbsp; gleaning
              information from one of the &quot;experts&quot; at the Shops in
              Cass, West Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;(That was really hard work!)&nbsp; One of the goals of the website
              is to pass on some of this research.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The website
      has a storage limit many times greater
      than I'll ever be able to fill so I encourage folks to send along (email
      or snail mail) photos of their geared locomotive projects to add to the <b>
      Photos</b> section. &nbsp; Also, please send along suggestions to add to the
      <b>References &amp; Links</b> section.&nbsp; While my engineering&nbsp; background helps with
        many aspects of locomotive construction,&nbsp; machining parts on the lathe
        and milling machine are the most important skills.&nbsp; My limited skills
      in that area are self taught by trial and error, with many errors per
        trial.&nbsp; So, most importantly, send along corrections and
      suggestions of the easy or best way to do the fabrication as I most likely found a sub optimal
      way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </p>
