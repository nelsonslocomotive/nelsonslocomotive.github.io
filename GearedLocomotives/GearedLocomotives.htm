        <p align="left">The vast majority of steam locomotives were <b>&quot;Rod
        Locomotives&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;Rod Engines&quot; </b>characterized by
        rods on the sides connecting the pistons in the steam cylinders to the
        drive wheels and interconnecting the multiple drive wheel axels. The
        photo below shows a small Civil War era&nbsp; rod locomotive.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="RodEngine.jpg" width="599" height="272">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">During the late 1800s rod locomotives started to appear in the
      logging camps of the eastern US ---- with limited success.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      back woods logging railroad
        presented a severe challenge to any engine as light gauge track was
        usually used over rough roadbed with steep grades and sharp
        turns.&nbsp; In some cases, logs rather than steel rails were used for
        track.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rod engine was ill suited for such poor roadbed
        because most the weight was concentrated over the short wheel base drivers, the turning
        radius was large and the action of the rods tended to tear out the
        curves.</p>
      <p align="left">The geared
        locomotive was developed to meet the unique challenges of the logging industry.&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of different designs were
        tried, three of which achieved major success with sales of over
        1,000 each.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An interesting aspect is that all
        three were manufactured near my home in central Ohio, one about 150
        miles to the northwest in Lima, Ohio and the other two about 200 miles to
        the northeast in Erie and nearby Corry, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">My view of the key features of these three successful
        designs are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Relatively small wheels mounted in freight car type
          trucks enabling a very short turning radius.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The two or three (and in a few cases four) trucks were spread out under the
          locomotive to distribute the weight over the greatest possible length of
          track.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The engine was coupled to the wheels and axels via
          drive shafts and gears.&nbsp;&nbsp; All wheels were driven to achieve
          the greatest possible traction over the maximum possible length of
          track.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">There was a gear reduction between the engine and
          drive axels on the order of 2:1&nbsp; which achieved a corresponding
          increase in torque that was further aided by the small wheels --- an
          effect similar to driving an auto in low gear.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a
          classic torque-speed trade off which was appropriate for the rough
          roadbeds --- 10 mph was really flying.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">All the geared locomotives were relatively light in
          comparison to rod locomotives of the era, ranging from about 10 tons
          initially to over 100 tons in the early 1900s.&nbsp; By comparison,
          the last of the big rod locomotives of the 1940s were over 500
          tons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p align="left">The most famous of the geared locomotives is probably the
      Lima Shay built in Lima, Ohio.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A unique feature of the
      Shay is that the engine (i.e. the cylinders) are mounted vertically on the
      right side of the locomotive with the power transferred to each axel via drive shafts and bevel gears.&nbsp; Because the engine
      and drive train are on the right side, the boiler is located off center to
      the left to balance the weight distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having the engine on
      the side permitted the addition of a third cylinder without upsetting the
      basic design.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following photo shows an 80 ton Shay
      built in 1905 and still running at Cass Scenic Railroad in West Virginia.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Cass5Shay.JPG" width="700" height="469"></p>
      <p align="left">Much more information about the Shays is available at:<br>
      <a href="http://www.shaylocomotives.com/">http://www.shaylocomotives.com/<br>
      </a>I find the sketches of the trucks, engines and drive shafts at
      following link particularly interesting:<br>

      <p align="left">Another design developed at about the same time as the
      Shay was the Climax, manufactured in Cory, Pennsylvania, a short distance
      from Eire, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Key distinguishing features of the Climax
      are cylinders mounted on the sides and all axels driven from drive shafts that
      run down the center
      of the locomotive.&nbsp; The
      cylinders on all except the very earliest models were mounted at an angle.&nbsp;
      The photo below shows a fairly small (~40 ton) two truck Climax still operating at a
      park in
      Durban, West Virginia.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Climax.JPG" width="600" height="436"></p>
        <p align="left">The most unique feature of the Climax design is the skewed
        (or offset) bevel gears that couple the crankshaft to the drive shaft
        and then the drive shaft to the axels.&nbsp; The drive shaft crosses
        below the crankshaft and above the axels.&nbsp; I understand&nbsp; this
        is the only known commercial application of these unique gears.&nbsp; The sketch
        below from an early Climax Catalog shows the Climax truck.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="ClimaxTruck.jpg" width="599" height="434">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">The third successful geared locomotive design was the
        Heisler built in Eire, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Heisler and Climax
        plants were a mere 20 miles apart and I understand used some
        of the same suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Photos from an early Heisler Catalog
      suggest that Heislers were used in both the mining and logging
      industries.&nbsp; The unique feature of the
        Heisler is a V type engine coupled to center drive shafts that couple to
      only one axel of each truck thus avoiding the need for the offset bevel gears
        of the Climax.&nbsp; The two axels of each truck are coupled with rods
        on the outside of the wheels.&nbsp; The photo below is of a 90 ton three
      truck Heisler that is still operational at Cass Scenic Railroad in West Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left">One might ask, which of these three competing designs is
        the best?&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is some marketing information from
        an early Heisler catalog.&nbsp; It is easy to find the not very subtle comparisons
        with the &quot;off-center&quot; Shay design and the excess use of
        &quot;inefficient gears&quot; in the Climax design&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="HeislerCatalog.jpg" width="700" height="933"></p>
      <p align="left">So, which do I think is the best? I guess I don't have to
      worry about best since I don't run a real railroad with real profit and
      loss concerns.&nbsp; I like them all, each for their unique features ---
      much like an appreciation for blondes, brunettes and
      redheads.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, one can't change a Shay to a Heisler with
      a few buckets of paint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Japanese engineer Kozo Hiraoka has constructed 3/4
      inch live steam models of the Shay, Heisler and the Climax and written separate
      books on how to build models of each.&nbsp; I'm envious.&nbsp; While I'm up to my
      ears building a shay at the moment, I've obtained a set of those unique
      Climax skew bevel gears in 1.6&quot; scale, so who knows what the future holds.</p>
